&lt;p&gt;It's never been easier to turning existing developers into Clojure developers.&lt;p&gt;A major problem people have at first[0] is just reading the code. AIs like ChatGPT and Claude are incredibly good at explaining existing Clojure code.&lt;p&gt;As a result, developers can onboard much, much faster.&lt;p&gt;[0] After a few weeks, reading Clojure becomes second nature and you'll forget you ever COULDN'T read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to dump a Clojure code base for Golang because it was too slow for lambda usage. Does any of this release help with startup time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dumb question: what is clojure usually used for ? (in my view, Java is for "enterprise" stuff, python for AI/data sciences, C for performance, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clojure is great. Brining together Lisp with the Java ecosystem makeand its concurrency model makes it great for building backend system, while still enabling quick changes.
One thing that I found noteworthy is that Clujure did not pickup some innovations happening at Java since like version 8, such as Invoke Dynamic in the JVM or streams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a wonderful language I've only just started paying attention to, watching the talks from Rich on YouTube have ruined things I loved (like Either types.) I'm struggling with how to introduce it into my company without recommending my colleagues follow my path of working through 3 books and then watching most of the conj talks from the last 12 years on 1.75x speed, while building a personal project and re-implementing a couple of services I work with every day in it... but the lessons around simplicity I think are so critical, I'm going to find a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought they were going to hold this until Clojure/conj 2024. No particular reason to believe so (besides Clojure 1.10 being released around the same time as Clojure/conj 2021 and the Datomic-becoming-free announcement being done at the very start of Clojure/conj 2023).&lt;p&gt;Still waiting on spec2, though... for now I am working around rigidity of specs by using Malli but it really isn't a first-class citizen in Clojure (mostly due to inability to check macros, and this is by design of the Clojure compiler). But you can emulate the ideas of schema/select by manipulating malli schemas as data.&lt;p&gt;The changes for functional interfaces also means we no longer have to maintain utility macros like&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  (defmacro -&gt;Consumer [f]
    `(reify java.util.function.Consumer
       (accept [this arg#]
         (~f arg#))))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
and instead just pass functions directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really a massive release with many cool new features&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite is add-libs&lt;p&gt;You can now write single file demos or minimal examples for issues. Really lowers the friction to share small runnable snippets with people&lt;p&gt;You can also actually use it to demo Java libraries as well without all the Java boilerplate. Just poke around in the REPL and paste code into a comment on HN or wherever and anyone can replicate your "setup" and get it running exactly the same. No need to clone a repo or anything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functional interface changes are huge. Clojure is always at its best when staying close to Java via judicious use of interop and this solves one of the major missing links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovely to see add-libs and sync-deps, aren't many (any?) reasons to close down a session at all now.&lt;p&gt;This release feels like it had a very different scope from previous releases, contains a lot of stuff, which is exciting to see! But I hope it doesn't end up like a hairball a few releases down from increase of pace or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; pornography/obscene content (31 per cent), copyright infringement (14 per cent)&lt;p&gt;&gt; We reiterate that Malaysia’s implementation is for the protection of vulnerable groups from harmful online content.&lt;p&gt;Who could possibly be harmed by pornography or, even more ridiculous, copyright infringement? Feels like a lame excuse.&lt;p&gt;Internet censorship in my country (Russia) started the same way — "we're protecting children from suicide and drugs", but &lt;i&gt;for some reason&lt;/i&gt; you couldn't opt out of the "protection" as an adult. To no one's surprise, over time, more and more things to non-consensually "protect" people from were added. In the end, unless you stick exclusively with local services, Russian-language content, and government-owned media, the internet is utterly broken without a VPN, packet fragmenter or other anti-censorship solution. Popular VPN protocols are also starting getting blocked, btw. All for your own safety, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just dns, so they don't get the entire url. I know, slippery slope and outrage and stuff, but at this point it is almost expected that any government in the world with access to sufficient IT skills would start political internet bans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in Malaysia (coincidentally around same time) MCMC hard blocking of SMS which contain URLs. Not clear if there's someway to whitelist certain URLs/domains--does anyone know?

&lt;p&gt;&gt; It has been falsely claimed that the measure undertaken by MCMC is a draconian measure.

&lt;p&gt;&gt; protection provided by the local ISP’s DNS servers and that malicious sites are inaccessible to Malaysians.&lt;p&gt;I'd really be curious if said "protection" is actually real...&lt;p&gt;Between dynamic domain name generation (ala malware), and (potentially) a lack of public review... this sounds more like smoke and mirrors.&lt;p&gt;Hopefully there is a way for users to set up a VPN and get access to a better DNS server without triggering the redirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension between borderless internet vs national sovereignty is one of most important meta-conflicts occurring in the world today. What can be critiqued as draconian authoritarianism on one hand, can be defended as digital sovereignty on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balkanization of the Internet is inevitable. As more and more people join it, there will be conflict between beliefs, values, and politics. Large markets like EU, India can keep companies aligned, but for smaller nations it will be easier to just selectively block global platforms and have local/compliant alternatives. China has shown it is possible and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminder: Malaysia is an &lt;i&gt;officially&lt;/i&gt; Islamic country. It is strange given its location, but Islamization also took over other South and East Asian places as well, like the Maldives and Indonesia.&lt;p&gt;Malaysia has had a history of religious discrimination from both the state and citizens, despite there being a freedom to practice whatever religion you want. Their notion of religious freedom is also strange, since in order to be considered a Malay you MUST be Muslim. And Malays get all sorts of additional rights and privileges (such as affirmative action). The country also has Sharia law courts - and this is a very real problem for personal freedom, because the Sharia court prevents Muslims from converting to other religions typically, and this forces people to have secret double lives, where privacy is critical.&lt;p&gt;Restrictions on Internet access or violations of privacy/anonymity are a serious problem for those who may run into trouble due to religious discrimination built into Malaysia’s culture and law. Do not accept official explanations like protecting people from harm or stopping misinformation - control over the internet will be abused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just wish this could give me a license to install the Lego Boost for Windows 10 app that used to be on the windows store until 2020...&lt;p&gt;From my understanding, if you have the license, then you can still download it but it's not available for new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ironically, I will be using un-ironically to play Guitar Hero games that I have the physically discs to, on retail hardware, that has the games installed, but not  "licensed" to play without physical tethering of the disc in the failed DVD drive.&lt;p&gt;The double irony is that, even if it works, I may not be able to read my own game-saves since the Console's own public key is on the revocation list. I could sidestep this by resigning the CON files with the default value, 0.&lt;p&gt;The triple irony may be forthcoming yet. this all looks very familiar indeed.&lt;p&gt;fuckin brilliant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; As it turns out, data after the signature block isnt checked at all... and it can even override data that came before it. Whenever two blocks of the same type are stored together, the last one overrides all the others before it. So, if we want to change any license data, we can just make a block for it and put it after the signature block!&lt;p&gt;Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I read this correctly, Microsoft will be able to reduce the applicability of the temporary-license signing key, meaning that you probably won’t be able to generate permanent licenses for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone knows a good way to activate MS Office on macOS ? Doesn't matter how many times I buy the thing it eventually forgets the license and calling Microsoft Support usually doesn't result in anything. One day Office starts complaining that it's not activated and then it eventually locks me out of it. It would be nice if the Office license on macOS actually worked but if there's an easy solution for activation I wouldn't look back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just stating the obvious, you can now (¥) download all xbox games directly from the microsoft store for free? 
I.e. the xbox is - for now - as completely hacked as the PS Vita?&lt;p&gt;(¥) you might have to figure out some details&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading the article, and specially the remarks about this engine being copy-pasted from the Xbox DRM engine , does anyone still believe that Pluton, also copy-pasted from the Xbox, is about end user security? And not totally about MS finally having enforceable DRM on PCs?&lt;p&gt;Oh and by the way Pluton is now on the latest batch of Intel laptop chips. And has been on AMDs for a while. How soon until Windows requires it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my personal use I found it trivial to activate my Win10 Professional. 
I just had to change the server address for the license check and boom fully activated. 
Not gonna share the specifics here but you can find it easily.&lt;p&gt;I guess the method described here does „more“ since it’s much more elaborate. Not super familiar with the different levels of win licences&lt;/p&gt;

<item><title>Tell HN: Burnout is bad to your brain, take care</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;I am depressed and burned out for quite some time already, unfortunately my brain still couldn't recover from it.&lt;p&gt;If I summarize the impact of burnout to my brain:&lt;p&gt;- Before: I could learn things pretty quickly, come up with solutions to the problems, even be able to see common patterns and see bigger underlying problems&lt;p&gt;- After: can't learn, can't work, can't remember, can't see solutions for trivial problems (e.g. if your shirt is wet, you can change it, but I stare at it thinking when it is going to get dried up)&lt;p&gt;Take care of your mental health&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I forgot who said this, but burnout is only the result of hard work not paying off.&lt;p&gt;When you work hard and things are going well, you get energized and can work 24/7.&lt;p&gt;When you work hard and things aren't panning out, you get "burnout".&lt;p&gt;This coincides with people who work extremely hard and have done so for decades (think of top tech founders... for example Jensen Huang: &lt;a href="https://x.com/seanpk/status/1829526623731024055" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://x.com/seanpk/status/1829526623731024055&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;p&gt;If you feel burnt out, chances are you're not getting the results you want. So instead of concluding "burnout is affecting my brain" I think the better reaction is to ask yourself "what needs to change?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt;- After: can't learn, can't work, can't remember, can't see solutions for trivial problems (e.g. if your shirt is wet, you can change it, but I stare at it thinking when it is going to get dried up)&lt;p&gt;I am having similar symptoms. I have suffered a lot at work, family problems and it conflicting with personal interests and hobbies. I trudged on with sheer will earlier and had unbounded enthusiasm, passion and motivation. Now everything is kind of broken and I feel I am just floating. Days passing by is just a blur. I have become completely disillusioned with society and its intentions and world just seems ultra complicated. I am not sure whether it is burnout as I don't have information of it nor do I have met people who suffer from it. I am not sure whether it is my age, diet or something else. :-(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same boat, and I wanted to add the worst thing... your energy level (or lack thereof)&lt;p&gt;I used to be able to play games or work for hours (even without taking breaks)&lt;p&gt;Currently I can do some simple things like making breakfast, taking care of personal hygiene, or write this small comment without getting tired, but if things get a little bit more complex I am getting so exhausted that I need to go to bed for a while.&lt;p&gt;Take good care of yourselves people, having a brain quit on you most of the time  really is not that great :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every-time burnout comes up, I can’t help but notice that people are describing my default state as someone with severe ADHD and a fundamental dopamine deficiency.  I can relate so much to every reported symptom that it becomes very difficult for me to frame burnout in the context of my own experience.  Medication, exercise, healthy food, and cold showers are the tools I’ve always used to get myself close enough to a neurotypical background to be able to do things like teach myself how to code.&lt;p&gt;I feel for you, and I wish you a swift recovery!  And if you get Covid, SLEEP AND CHUG WATER like your life depends on it, or you may get permanent burnout in the form of long covid (my worst nightmare), without the hope of recovery that you currently have to look forward to and strive towards :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was doing a startup with a high achiever, I estimate ~160 IQ or higher; he worked 7 days a week, at least 12 hours a day, but often 16 for at least 20 years.  He was a step-change smarter than me; PhD in Chem E. from top school, brilliant computer scientist... the only time I saw him relax is once he played Sonic the Hedgehog for like 10 hours straight.  He fried his motherboard... his wife texted me one day... he's in a coma... 12 days later he emerges from the hospital with amenesia... that was years ago, still has amensia, can't create new long-term memories, can't work, etc.&lt;p&gt;One thing that helped me during burnout is reading biographies, idk why it helped, but I'm passing it forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Burnt out &lt;i&gt;badly&lt;/i&gt; in 2022, empty tank, few “can’t get up” episodes. It took six months and one trouble only to find a stable point in my mind, but recovering didn’t even start then. I’m almost two years floating free (thank myself being smart with money) and am even trying a couple activities this year, but it takes time to replace the broken parts.&lt;p&gt;All, ymmw, but take note you may not recover from it by simply taking a vacation.&lt;p&gt;Btw, distancing didn’t work for me. It was the opposite, I couldn’t work in an env that couldn’t care less as a whole.&lt;p&gt;Another note is that eat, shit and sleep system is in a strong feedback loop with all that.&lt;p&gt;Also, I was alone most of my life and fine with it, but living with a relative suddenly changed a few things that I can’t explain. Simple human presence shifts something, although I’m not craving for it and find it burdensome in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have burned out at least 10 times in my career. The last time, it was like I lost half a decade, even though it didn't last quite that long. It was as if I had amnesia. I fell into a deep depression. I considered killing myself just because everything seemed so difficult and pointless.&lt;p&gt;Give yourself some more time. You might not emerge exactly as who you remember, but its possible to mostly recover from the pretty extreme cognitive impairment that you are likely struggling through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went through a similar thing, two years on I’m still not recovered.&lt;p&gt;Just to say that even though it might not feel like it right now, it eventually gets better. You have to give it time. Sometimes a long time. And seek support from friends and family but also from a professional.&lt;p&gt;And once you’ve recovered, learn the signs so you can see it coming and prevent it. Leaving a shitty job or even a profession that doesn’t work for you anymore is always preferable than getting burnt out.&lt;p&gt;Good luck, friend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know when you are burned out and you seek advice from other people?
Brain fog? exercise, magnesium and so on
Can't sleep? drink milk
Tired? Eat well, take vitamins&lt;p&gt;I did all these and while it did help, it also felt like I was returning $1 on a $1 million debt.&lt;p&gt;So the wort burnout I've got was due to some stomach bug. This prevented the normal absorption of food and soon enough I was running on fumes (while still being quite active).&lt;p&gt;What's interesting is that at this point all those advises don't actually solve anything, they might even make things worse.&lt;p&gt;Brain fog? you don't get any fuel for your brain, so yes brain frog. Do you also exercise or do some treks? Your fuel tank is empty and you force your body to eat into your body to take what it needs. It will make you fell worse, not better. If you exercise and almost immediately feel sleepy, that's a clear sign.
Can't sleep? yes, chronic illness will do that to you. Your body is in a state of panic because it knows that something is very wrong. You don't fall asleep anymore, you just collapse from being awake for too long.
Depressed? all your days start to look a like, chronic illness will do that to you.
Anxious? you drink chamomile tea? will not fix the underlying issue. Nice try.&lt;p&gt;So you find the actual problem and you fix it. Now you are OK, right? well no. You are missing all the minerals and all the vitamins your body could not absorb. I took some multivitamins and that felt good, some magnesium and I felt only a little better and the last one was Vitamin C. That felt amazing. All the muscle and joint pain, and lack of focus disappeared.
Suddenly I could focus, I could exercise, I could cook for myself, go out and so on. Only from this point forward I can follow those well meaning advises.&lt;p&gt;Not sure from where I took the bug, my guess is the water. Given that a lot of people don't actually have access to good water I think it's very common. Also a big problem is that you don't actually feel ill. I never had diarrhea for example. It starts very innocent as a mood change and nothing else: you don't quite feel it today, a little hard to focus, you sleep a little worse next day/week/month and now you are even less able to focus, but you blame it on the bad sleep and so on. The things compound and once you are in that hole it's much harder to get out.&lt;p&gt;So my advice is if you have a bad mood for a long period of time, then you might have something physically wrong with you and look into that. No amount of meditation, tea or anything else, can fix that for you.&lt;p&gt;Interestingly I had periods in which I felt better. It turns out I was consuming Coca-Cola which has a slight antibacterial effect. But given that I didn't know the root cause at the time, I felt worse when I was trying to live healthy and so I stopped the Coke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a convergence of a few things that caused a huge burnout - building work on my house, 18 month long software project implementation that eventually failed, and stress that comes from being a sole provider.&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I woke one day and couldn't talk, this went on for a couple of weeks. It wasn't until 4 to 6 weeks later that I could get out of bed. I just broke.&lt;p&gt;Discovered from this that I was autistic and had an autistic burnout, but I've not been the same since, I'm better than I was but lesser than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fellow burn-out, here. For about 3/4 years, I have noticed a massive increase in my Depression and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My wife has also noticed my personality changes that have occured, and my general loss of interest in things that used to bring me joy.&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with Depression and GAD in 2000 after a fairly long and drawn out process that told me something I already knew. In the nearly 25 since, I have been hyperaware of the impact exteenal factors have on my conditions and over-all state of being.&lt;p&gt;In the event that it helps anyone, even a single person reading this, here is what I have learned:&lt;p&gt;1. It's okay to walk away from a toxic work environment. I have done a lot of work in factories over the years. Between the harsh conditions, unrealistic expectations and juvenile masculinity, I was getting mentally beat to a pulp because I thought I was supposed to uphold the status quo in those places. The status quo, as it turns out, is set by people who are more miserable than you and want to drag you to Hell with them. Let them go and walk away. Being driven to the point of drug abuse (or worse) is not worth any paycheck.&lt;p&gt;2. You are greater than the sum of your parts. You are not your job, your hobbies, your clothes, etc, but an amalgamation of all those things that is not necessarily unique, but a whole and contributing person, and that cannot be taken from you unless YOU allow it to be.&lt;p&gt;3. Avoid seeking reason for everything outside your control. The sooner you accept the Universe has no plan that you can comprehend, the better. It is a chaotic, irrational place from our tiny perspective and not a useful line of inquiry. Instead, your energies can be turned to your reason for your own actions and reactions, the only things you can really control.&lt;p&gt;4. Be firm but fair with self-honesty. Your faults are also opprtunities to improve, not road blocks. This will ne exceptionally difficult, but your strengths will see you through. My personal rule is to never stop tryinh to ne better than I was yesterday, for falling stagnant is no different than being dead.&lt;p&gt;5. Leave your spaces better than you found them...not just for other people, but also for yourself. When we take care of our immediate environments, we tend to feel more focused and energized. My depression stints are often followed by house-cleaning, and it surprises me every single time how cluttered and disoriented I allowed things to get.&lt;p&gt;I believe people with Anxiety and Depression are more prone to burnout than others, and in the societies that tend to demand more of us than we can give, be it as workers, lovers, consumers or citizens, we are a particularly vulnerable population. That means we must fight harder.&lt;p&gt;My burnout has taken me to dark, dark places, and there are lights that keep me going. Right now, I am mustering what evergy I can to help my son learn to cope with these things while teaching myself new skills so I can make a move into a career that will be more rewarding and inline with my personal ethos.&lt;p&gt;What works for you? What helps with burnout, and the anxiety/depression that tends to come with it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a different view on this, maybe it's because I'm in the depths of burnout. I don't think I am - I walked away from my career in tech about 2 years ago, and it still feels like the right thing to do. Threads like this do make me think and question it a bit, so feedback appreciated.&lt;p&gt;The essence is I suspect there's a perfect correlation between the increased mention/awareness of burnout, and the stupid in-your-face selfish, aggressive capitalism that inspires many in VC backed tech leadership positions.&lt;p&gt;Everyone I've personally known who's experienced burnout has typically been an ultra-high achiever: they have a personality type that just wants the world to be better for everyone, and they go and try and do that. They do tech because that's what they've done since they could walk/talk. They're star employees when being themselves, but being themselves becomes impossible to sustain in an environment where a bunch of people just want to selfishly improve their own world without caring about others.&lt;p&gt;When I  think about it this way, I then worry about the world we're creating by telling people with burnout to be more selfish, rather than telling the leaders and environments that lead to burnout that they're the problem.&lt;p&gt;Maybe that's all burnout talking though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm dealing with burnout and unemployment, and it's legitimately the hardest time in my life to self-start and do anything other than basic life functions. Some days I have a wellspring of energy, but most days I'm just existing. I realized I don't even have the luxury of forgoing my mental health, if I don't work on it now things won't ever get better. And my programming skills aren't stagnating, but MAN I feel like I'm not getting better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn't one of best ways to verify this is to computationally "detonate" a similar model? If it's real, it should compress nuclear part, if it's not, it behaves like a HEAT warhead or whatever it is based on, or is that not the case?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would have made a good Silicon Valley plot: they discover they accidentally put a trade secret in their logo, and have to jump through hoops to collect, hide, and delete the bad version without making competitors curious about their effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've worked on (unrelated to nuclear stuff) computer simulation projects for the Navy where they had standard, notional models of the battleship which had the same sort of general properties you'd expect a battleship to have, but wasn't based on the design of any real battleship, so they could share them with researchers to develop their codes on without having to worry about revealing classified details.&lt;p&gt;Wonder if this isn't something similar, if the DoE has some sort of "standardized notional warhead" design they can use to give to outside researchers without having to give every post-doc and grad-student a security clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing he doesn't consider: Perhaps if they do not call it a nuclear warhead, or place it in the context of a larger drawing that tells you it's a warhead, having a sort of blobby, colorful model shape is considered plausibly nonsensical enough that it doesn't matter to the censors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; This is the kind of thing that I think people assume the government labs might do, but in my experience, is pretty unusual and pretty unlikely. In general, you have to remember that the national laboratories are pretty, well, boring, when it comes to classified information. They want to be boring in this respect. They are not doing cloak-and-dagger stuff on the regular. They’re scientists and engineers for the most part. These are not James Bond-wannabes.&lt;p&gt;The Sandia folks may be extra special, it is a pretty famous place. But engineers are people first of course, so lots of variation. And also, some are super serious of course, but there are hacker tendencies, playful tendencies. I bet if some intelligence agency folks wanted to, they could find some engineers out there who’d be receptive to this sort of thing.&lt;p&gt;If it is a fake, known-stupid design, including it would be a funny prank that wastes the time of people that might want to nuke us, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heh.  Ask my mother about the time that Sandia dropped an atomic bomb casing in the streets of Albuquerque.&lt;p&gt;IIRC the story, this was still during WWII.  They were testing the flight characteristics of the bomb casing.  It did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; contain a core.  But it was still extremely classified.  They had the test casing in the back of a truck, taking it from Sandia to Kirtland AFB.  The truck got in an accident, the tailgate fell open, and the bomb casing fell out and went rolling around in the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume the schematic depicts a genuine weapon, and that this was a massive redaction screw-up.&lt;p&gt;I think the author is omitting the most likely explanation for why it wasn't redacted in future publications.&lt;p&gt;It took from 2007 to 2024 for someone (him) to publicly notice this.&lt;p&gt;If your job was to censor documents coming out of Sandia National Laboratories, and you screwed up this massively, what's your incentive to call attention to your screw-up?&lt;p&gt;Better to just coast along, by the time you retire or move on to another job your ass is off the firing line.&lt;p&gt;Ditto (but less so) if this was your co-worker or team mate, after all North Korea, Iran etc. &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; have access to the published document.&lt;p&gt;What could anyone in your organization possibly gain from the ensuing shitstorm of admitting something like that?&lt;p&gt;Has this person worked, well, pretty much anywhere, where people have a stronger incentive to cover their own ass and keep out of trouble than not?&lt;p&gt;Or, that internal report and subsequent shitstorm &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; happen, but what do you do at that point? Make a big public fuss about it, and confirm to state actors that you accidentally published a genuine weapons design?&lt;p&gt;No, you just keep cropping that picture a bit more, eventually phase it out, and hope it's forgotten. Maybe they'll just think it's a detailed mockup of a test article. If it wasn't for that meddling blogger...&lt;p&gt;Edit: Also, I bet there's nobody involved in the day-to-day of redacting documents that's aware of what an actual weapons design looks like. That probably happens at another level of redaction.&lt;p&gt;So once something like this slips by it's just glazed over as "ah, that's a bit detailed? But I guess it was approved already, as it's already published? Moving on.".&lt;p&gt;Whereas a censor would have to know what an actual thermonuclear device looks like to think "Holy crap! Who the hell approved this?!". And even then they and the organization still need the incentive to raise a fuss about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminds me of another design secret that leaked out because someone published a paper titled something like "X-ray crystallography of Lithium Deuteride under high pressure."&lt;p&gt;People very quickly figured out that this was the source of the D-T fuel in fusion part of the bomb instead of cryogenic D-T liquid. Lithium Deuteride is nasty stuff, but it's a storable solid. When bombarded with neutrons from the fission primary, the Lithium splits and forms tritium, which then combines with the deuterium that was the other half of the crystal.&lt;p&gt;The reason the usage was obvious (from the title alone!) is that very few chemists would care about any property of Lithium Hydride, which is dangerous to handle and has few practical uses. Lithium Deuteride is unheard of in analytical chemistry, and its crystallography &lt;i&gt;under high pressure&lt;/i&gt; is totally uninteresting to anyone... except physicists working on atomic weapons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.  That is not a nuke.  It is a mass simulator, specifically the electronic model of a mass simulator for a warhead. The various colors represent density of material. This would be used during aerodynamic simulations.  That is why it is behind the graph about processors. This also explains the simple geometry as keeping things simple reduces the number of calculations.&lt;p&gt;(Note that nuke warheads fall nose-first, the opposite of space capsules.  So the dense material is packed in the nose, with the lighter stuff at the back.)&lt;p&gt;The nearby disk looks like a represention of airflow around a falling warhead. They, like apollo, likely had an offset center of gravity that allowed them to stear by rotation, creating the asymetrical airflow shown on the disk. Falling in a spiral also probably frustrates interception. So that whole corner of the image is advertising Sandia's ability to do aerodynamic simulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are confused why this could be a big deal. An analogy: on GitHub, if you echo a GitHub access token in an action’s log, it will be automatically censored. This post would be like noticing that someone’s action step is just named ghp_1ae27h… and that the name isn’t censored, and speculating on what that says about the token-censorship algorithm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bet it's an inside joke, like Lenna.jpeg. Some outdated / test / dead-end, or otherwise harmless project put there as a wink to everyone involved in the industry. Maybe it's something an intern ruined on his first day and made entire lab work on for three weeks without realizing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the guy who produced that part of the graphic was not told what a thermonuclear warhead actually looks like, because he didn't need to know, so he just whipped up his own idea of it from speculative public images.  Knowing that the graphic came from somebody who didn't actually know anything, the censors didn't see the need to worry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your comments, just some context:&lt;p&gt;- The app is a simple desktop application that works on macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu.&lt;p&gt;- I developed this app for my own needs. Getting tired of SaaS app subscriptions and privacy concerns.&lt;p&gt;- For now, the activities are logged manually or imported from a CSV file. No integration with Plaid or other platforms.&lt;p&gt;- No monetization is planned for now (only a "buy me a coffee" if you use and appreciate the app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tried it quickly on a personal machine running windows; all attempts at submitting `BUY`s for popular tickers (regardless of price, tax, quantity, ticker, date) seem to result in an unknown error. Notably, I tried having the account match the ticker's currency, but that does not fix it.&lt;p&gt;This feels like an MVP at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've developed an app for my own use (which doesn't look anywhere near as good visually!).&lt;p&gt;My biggest pain points were cleaning the account data, to make it suitable for import, and getting the appropriate prices so I can see the value of the accounts at any point.&lt;p&gt;My financial institution has two sets of downloadable CSV files - one for cash movements, one for stock transactions. They don't include stock symbols, just a "description" which occasionally changes.
I'd suggest a plugin system where uploaded statements can be transformed first (depending on where they are from) into the common format your app imports. This would provide a useful point where people could contribute to the app.&lt;p&gt;Pricing is something I found hard too - I also use yahoo for current prices, along with a couple of other sources. Historical price ranges can be very hard to come by, at least for free and in easily accessible forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks beautiful. I am building in the same way, a private app, runs on desktop, same tech stack.&lt;p&gt;I have a very generous free tier and I want to add two paid tiers.

&lt;p&gt;This is the second time I've looked at this and I can't get past the chart having no labels or axes. I have no investments at all, but I feel like if I wanted a chart, I'd want to not be required to interact with it to see information. Likewise with the Apple-esque ambiguous financial goal progress bars or whatever. Is it 60% or 20 out of 30 dollars over what period of time? Feels like removing information didn't help here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly encourage you to charge (lots) of money ASAP. I love the open source, offline, rent-free ethnos but also if you've built something truly valuable, charge money for it. Donations don't count as a viable monetization strategy.&lt;p&gt;Even if the software is free and you're just offering $500/hour consulting as an add-on to the software, that helps me trust the project has sticking power.&lt;p&gt;P.S. I think Tauri is such a cool framework and a delight to use. Rust's approach to platform-specific code is so much saner than anything I've tried previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does this handle dividends/dividend reinvestment - this is typically my biggest gripe with portfolio tracking tools, they are really good at telling you how much you have, and not very good at telling you how you’ve done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working on configuring a similar private, open source portfolio tracker built on top of ledger (a double-entry accounting system). I was drawn to it because of its yml config that I can version control easily&lt;p&gt;If anyone has set up Paisa (successfully or unsuccessfully) and has anything to share, I'd love to hear it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://paisa.fyi/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://paisa.fyi/&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the taxonomy of RF circuits, the pickle is an (extremely inefficient) direct-conversion receiver.&lt;p&gt;I've seen at least on video of this being done with a wrench, where the RF current forms a visible arc through the air to the wrench.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sort of a side note for everyone who thinks AM radio is dead as a useful medium, they've probably never lived and driven a car in a city that has:&lt;p&gt;(a) a 50kW AM radio station with frequent and accurate traffic updates, often much better detail than what you can get from using google maps or waze or similar, and&lt;p&gt;(b) massive, frequent traffic problems and congestion at major bridge and tunnel locations.&lt;p&gt;It's still a very useful thing to have when driving and you don't need to take your eyes off the road at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related topic, they used to sell to consumers hot-dog cookers that just put mains voltage through a hot-dog.

&lt;p&gt;Is pickle a new term for hot dogs? Probably similar conductors are congruent in this case, the heating/buring makes a lot of sense but what I wonder though is how it produces sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thing that just happened in Boston is that Bloomberg swapped their relatively low power transmitters with iHeart's Alternative Rock 92.9.  This is awesome for Bloomberg's reach, but it means that we now have an AM rock station, probably for the first time since the 1960s: 1330 AM.  We'll see how long this lasts..  Red Hot Chili Peppers on AM right now..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tech trivia related to this that springs to mind is that the DEC Alpha processor was known internally by the code name EV, which stood for "Electric Vlasic" — although the suits backfit this in to "Extended VAX".&lt;p&gt;(Vlasic is an American pickle brand.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;side comment; Cub Scout project books of the 1960s, as I recall, had you make a hot dog cooker by connecting line voltage to two nails through a board...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm curious as to how much paperwork was involved here. Was the pickle grounding out the transmitter and (presumably) interrupting the broadcast not an issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For folks wondering why these sort of videos (there are lots on YouTube) always focus on AM towers:&lt;p&gt;1. On AM the radio energy literally pulses (the amplitude modulation) and thus the arcs of plasma will pulse too thus creating the audio noise. AM has a carrier wave that’s constant but the two sidebands of signal pulse from zero energy at silence to more power the louder the sound being transmitted. FM signals broadcast essentially the same power all the time since it’s the frequency and not the amplitude that’s changing.&lt;p&gt;2. Because the signal frequency is much lower on the AM broadcast bands the wavelength is much larger and thus the antennas are much bigger. On AM the tower itself is typically the antenna vs FM radio where the antenna is typically only a meter or two long at the top of a very tall tower. That’s what makes AM towers more dangerous as the tower can be carrying many kW of energy and if you touch it you’ll go zap zap. The towers typically sit on top of a ceramic insulator to insulate them from the ground whereas FM towers typically just are attached right to the ground (although with grounding straps for lightning protection).&lt;p&gt;Finally (some folks don’t always know this) you can operate AM on the frequencies typically used for FM… it’s just a mode and works on any frequency. Aviation radios operate on AM but in the VHF band near FM broadcast frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand he got permission and everything was checked out by actual RF eggheads, but damn. I won't even change a HV run capacitor unless i'm wearing crocs, standing on cement, and wearing the rubber oven mitts. And even then, I keep one hand behind my back. Because there have been accidents, and they hurt (the pool pump run cap fails approximately annually in this climate and if I paid someone to change it every time, I'd be a lot poorer).&lt;p&gt;That said, the food demodulating the signal into audible noise is badass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A soapbox of mine here in the UK is that since BBC and commercial AM radio is more or less dead with the remaining stations set to close over the next few years, Ofcom should open up the band to low-power broadcasting hobbyists. These already exist illegitimately and have done for decades, you can pick up plenty from the Netherlands and a few domestic ones as well on a sporadic schedule.&lt;p&gt;It would be a nice thing to do from several angles I think and would help drive interest in radio as a technology in general; as well as building transmitters and aerial systems, there's things like setting up an audio processing chain to get the best possible modulation and being a disc jockey which will always have a bit of a buzz from being on the 'real' radio. If valves and vintage equipment are involved it would be an interesting form of technology history preservation and 'living history', and there's also an environmental angle where old analogue radio receivers could be prevented from becoming e-waste.&lt;p&gt;There could be a minimal licencing regime to demonstrate the individual is not a complete numpty and a fee to PRS for music rights along the lines of how streaming works. Maximum power could be kept low especially at night to avoid interfering with countries in Europe where AM radio is still an active platform, and I don't think there'd need to be a lot of enforcement with respect to content since you'd only realistically be broadcasting to other anoraks. Additionally there's already precedent for non-profit stations where the medium of AM itself plays a role, for example former pirate Radio Caroline which uses it to keep its historic radio ship in operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I didn't see explained in these videos, and which I'm now curious about, is the mechanism by which the hot dogs convert the radio signal into sound? 
I understand how a loudspeaker works, but since food products typically don't contain coils and magnets, how was the AM signal being demodulated and converted into sound waves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Right now, we have about 800 monthly donors and about $7,500 in monthly donations. That covers our server costs pretty much exactly.&lt;p&gt;For only 2M &lt;i&gt;registered&lt;/i&gt; (not even monthly) users? Tell me you are using AWS without telling me you are using AWS.&lt;p&gt;Let's think about their heaviest workload, which is likely running user-submitted code server-side to test those exercise submissions. Say it's really bad performance-wise and costs 1s of single-core CPU time per submission. 45m submission gets us 520 days of CPU time.&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go out on a limb and claim their entire site could run off a $50/month dedicated server, and it would be unimpressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for being upfront honest and transparent:&lt;p&gt;If you have that amount of users and you cant even pay 3(!) people, then your business model is massivly f&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;i*g wrongly configured, Jesus!&lt;p&gt;You have that much traffic and you are unable to monetiz - i guess, this is because the "founder" is also the lead developer and the product genius.&lt;p&gt;You need some business guys to tune this!&lt;p&gt;Jesus, if this product fails, it will be a great example in whatever Stanford Business 101 course :-))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise seems like a goldmine for coding LLMs:The same challenges solved again and again using different languages and user provided feedback. Much better for analysis and training than random GitHub repositories.&lt;p&gt;Have you tried selling access to that data to the usual suspects ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a very useful service. I just signed up. Did you consider to inform new users that the service is financed by donations? You seem to focus on "always free" which is nice but I guess most people are also ok to pay some money if your service is useful to them. I guess this might drive some more donations if people knew that you need money. Also a banner like Wikipedia (maybe a bit less annoying) would work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that you are not making money on this at all, it would be wise to consider charging a small amount. If the number of users drops because of this, you still won't have lost any money. But those who choose to stay will help make this sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adsense alone would more than cover this.&lt;p&gt;Of the 2M users, guessing the MAU is much lower, which would render the ad model non viable.&lt;p&gt;Still always sucks to see solid products rendered unsupportable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way to get funding through libraries? Kind of like how it's possible to read subscription journals and newspapers for "free" in the library. The library must be paying for the subscription right? I think there is a strong values alignment with public libraries and exercism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercism is a great site and I'll be sad if it goes away entirely. It's a really wonderful service and community.&lt;p&gt;I used it [throughout 2023](&lt;a href="https://xavd.id/blog/post/12-languages-in-12-months/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://xavd.id/blog/post/12-languages-in-12-months/&lt;/a&gt;) to tour new languages and have been on a deep dive of Rust this year in their [48in24 program](&lt;a href="https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://exercism.org/challenges/48in24&lt;/a&gt;). The UI and tooling is great, there are real humans available to mentor and everything is open source and volunteer driven. They make learning fun and that's no small feat.&lt;p&gt;Of course, things like this cost money to run, especially when there's so much going on behind the scenes. Sad that the current iteration hasn't worked out financially, but I have every faith in the team that there are good things ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know if iHiD will see this, but this is Lane, the founder of Boot.dev. One of our students shared this article with me, and it really sucks to see. Exercism has always been a go to recommendation of mine for students who need additional practice or to learn languages we don't yet teach.&lt;p&gt;I know you mentioned you don't wanna do ads, which makes sense. But if you're getting 1200 sign ups a day thats worth a lot, and id be happy to chat and see if there's a sponsor opportunity thats uninvasive and that could at least keep you going.&lt;p&gt;anyhow, you can reach me on Twitter @wagslane or via email: lane @ boot dev.&lt;p&gt;either way, hope things turn around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They shouldn't have advertised 'free forever' on the website. OMG. In that area, people don't even think about the next day.&lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned is that you should never offer even one tiny ounce of added value which the average user is not capable of perceiving.&lt;p&gt;Literally the entire idea of profit   rests on arbitraging between perception and reality. You don't want to pay for surplus value that is beyond your customer's perceptive capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work on Batch Compress (&lt;a href="https://batchcompress.com/en" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://batchcompress.com/en&lt;/a&gt;) and recently added WebP support, then made it the default soon after.&lt;p&gt;As far as I know, it was already making the smallest JPEGs out of any of the web compression tools, but WebP was coming out only ~50% of the size of the JPEGs. It was an easy decision to make WebP the default not too long after adding support for it.&lt;p&gt;Quite a lot of people use the site, so I was anticipating some complaints after making WebP the default, but it's been about a month and so far there has been only one complaint/enquiry about WebP. It seems that almost all tools &amp; browsers now support WebP. I've only encountered one website recently where uploading a WebP image wasn't handled correctly and blocked the next step. Almost everything supports it well these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is actually possible to use Brotli directly in the web browser... with caveats of course. I believe my 2022 submission to JS1024 [1] is the first ever demonstration of this concept, and I also have a proof-of-concept code for the arbitrary compression (which sadly didn't work for the original size-coding purpose though). The main caveat is that you are effectively limited to the ASCII character, and that it is highly sensitive to the rendering stack for the obvious reason---it no longer seems to function in Firefox right now.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://js1024.fun/demos/2022/18/readme" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://js1024.fun/demos/2022/18/readme&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/lifthrasiir/1c7f9c5a421ad39c1af19a9c4f060743" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://gist.github.com/lifthrasiir/1c7f9c5a421ad39c1af19a9c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Typically, Brotli is better than gzip, and gzip is better than nothing. gzip is so cheap everyone enables it by default, but Brotli is way slower.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;i&gt;way slower&lt;/i&gt; applies to speed of compression, not decompression. So Brotli is a good bet if you can precompress.&lt;p&gt;&gt; &lt;i&gt;Annoyingly, I host my blog on GitHub pages, which doesn’t support Brotli.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your users all use modern browsers and you host static pages through a service like Cloudflare or CloudFront that supports custom HTTP headers, you can implement your own Brotli support by precompressing the static files with Brotli and adding a &lt;i&gt;Content-Encoding: br&lt;/i&gt; HTTP header. This is kind of cheating because you are ignoring proper content negotiation with &lt;i&gt;Accept-Encoding&lt;/i&gt;, but I’ve done it successfully for sites with targeted user bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt;ensure it works without JavaScript enabled&lt;p&gt;&gt;manually decompress it in JavaScript&lt;p&gt;&gt;Brotli decompressor in WASM&lt;p&gt;the irony seems lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So... 60kB less of transfer... and how much slower is it on an eg. galaxy s8 phone my mom has, because of all the shenanigans done to save those 60kB?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's impressive how close this is to Brotli even though brotli has this massive pre-shared dictionary. Is the actual compression algorithm used by it just worse, or does the dictionary just matter much less than I think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of nice tricks in here, definitely fun! Only minor nitpick is that it departs fairly rapidly from the lede ... which espouses the dual virtues of an accessible and js-optional reading experience ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I seek in an image format:&lt;p&gt;(1) compatibility&lt;p&gt;(2) features&lt;p&gt;WebP still seems far behind on (1) to me so I don't care about the rest. I hope it gets there, though, because folks like this seem pretty enthusiastic about (2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same vein, you can package HTML pages as self-extracting ZIP files with SingleFile [1]. You can even include a PNG image to produce files compatible with HTML, ZIP and PNG [2], and for example display the PNG image in the HTML page [3].&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile?tab=readme-ov-file#file-format-comparison"&gt;https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile?tab=readme-ov-f...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG"&gt;https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3] &lt;a href="https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/raw/main/demo.png.zip.html"&gt;https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/Polyglot-HTML-ZIP-PNG/raw/...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the linked Github issue giving the rationale why Brotli is not available in the CompressionStream API:&lt;p&gt;&gt; As far as I know, browsers are only shipping the decompression dictionary. Brotli has a separate dictionary needed for compression, which would significantly increase the size of the browser.&lt;p&gt;How can the decompression dictionary be smaller than the compression one? Does the latter contain something like a space-time tradeoff in the form of precalculated most efficient representations of given input substrings or something similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did all this and didn't even measure time to first paint?&lt;p&gt;What is the point of doing this sort of thing if you dont even test how much faster or slower it made the page to load?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what is the difference in CPU usage on client side for WebP variant vs standard HTML? Are you causing more battery drain on visitor devices?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dropping google fonts should improve page load time a bit too, considering those are loaded from remote server that requires additional handshake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't know canvas anti-fingerprinting was so rudimentary. I don't think it increases uniqueness (the noise is different every run) but bypassing it seems trivial: run the thing n times and take the mode. With so little noise, 4 or 5 times should be more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page is broken at least on Sailfish OS browser, there is a long empty space after the paragraph:&lt;p&gt;&gt; Alright, so we’re dealing with 92 KiB for gzip vs 37 + 71 KiB for Brotli. Umm…&lt;p&gt;That said, the overhead of gzip vs brotli HTML compression is nothing compared with amount of JS/images/video current websites use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; that (encoding stuff in &lt;i&gt;webp&lt;/i&gt;) but my takeaway from the figures in the article is this: brotli is so good I'll host from somewhere where I can serve brotli (when and if the client supports brotli ofc).&lt;/p&gt;

<item><title>Show HN: Infinity – Realistic AI characters that can speak</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Hey HN, this is Lina, Andrew, and Sidney from Infinity AI (&lt;a href="https://infinity.ai/"&gt;https://infinity.ai/&lt;/a&gt;). We've trained our own foundation video model focused on people. As far as we know, this is the first time someone has trained a video diffusion transformer that’s driven by audio input. This is cool because it allows for expressive, realistic-looking characters that actually speak. Here’s a blog with a bunch of examples: &lt;a href="https://toinfinityai.github.io/v2-launch-page/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://toinfinityai.github.io/v2-launch-page/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to try it out, you can either (1) go to &lt;a href="https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2"&gt;https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2&lt;/a&gt;, or (2) post a comment in this thread describing a character and we’ll generate a video for you and reply with a link. For example: 
“Mona Lisa saying ‘what the heck are you smiling at?’”: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3z8l1TM" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://bit.ly/3z8l1TM&lt;/a&gt; 
“A 3D pixar-style gnome with a pointy red hat reciting the Declaration of Independence”: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/3XzpTdS" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://bit.ly/3XzpTdS&lt;/a&gt; 
“Elon Musk singing Fly Me To The Moon by Sinatra”: &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/47jyC7C" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://bit.ly/47jyC7C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our tool at Infinity allows creators to type out a script with what they want their characters to say (and eventually, what they want their characters to do) and get a video out. We’ve trained for about 11 GPU years (~$500k) so far and our model recently started getting good results, so we wanted to share it here. We are still actively training.&lt;p&gt;We had trouble creating videos of good characters with existing AI tools. Generative AI video models (like Runway and Luma) don’t allow characters to speak. And talking avatar companies (like HeyGen and Synthesia) just do lip syncing on top of the previously recorded videos. This means you often get facial expressions and gestures that don’t make sense with the audio, resulting in the “uncanny” look you can’t quite put your finger on. See blog.&lt;p&gt;When we started Infinity, our V1 model took the lip syncing approach. In addition to mismatched gestures, this method had many limitations, including a finite library of actors (we had to fine-tune a model for each one with existing video footage) and an inability to animate imaginary characters.&lt;p&gt;To address these limitations in V2, we decided to train an end-to-end video diffusion transformer model that takes in a single image, audio, and other conditioning signals and outputs video. We believe this end-to-end approach is the best way to capture the full complexity and nuances of human motion and emotion. One drawback of our approach is that the model is slow despite using rectified flow (2-4x speed up) and a 3D VAE embedding layer (2-5x speed up).&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things the model does surprisingly well on: (1) it can handle multiple languages, (2) it has learned some physics (e.g. it generates earrings that dangle properly and infers a matching pair on the other ear), (3) it can animate diverse types of images (paintings, sculptures, etc) despite not being trained on those, and (4) it can handle singing. See blog.&lt;p&gt;Here are some failure modes of the model: (1) it cannot handle animals (only humanoid images), (2) it often inserts hands into the frame (very annoying and distracting), (3) it’s not robust on cartoons, and (4) it can distort people’s identities (noticeable on well-known figures). See blog.&lt;p&gt;Try the model here: &lt;a href="https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2"&gt;https://studio.infinity.ai/try-inf2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d love to hear what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's awesome for very short texts. Like a single long sentence. For even a bit longer sequences it seems to be losing adherence to the initial photo and also venture into uncanny valley with exaggerated facial expressions.&lt;p&gt;A product that might be build on top of this could split the input into reasonable chunks, generate video for each of them separately and stitch them with another model that can transition from one facial expression into another in a fraction of a second.&lt;p&gt;Additional improvement might be feeding the system not with one image but with a few expressing different emotional expressions. Then the system could analyze the split input to find out in which emotional state each part of the video should be started on.&lt;p&gt;On unrelated note ... generated expressions seem to be relevant to the content of the input text. So either text to speech might understand language a bit or the video model itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's very exciting that generative ai lets people get more code written, especially in unfamiliar domains. It feels great to ship loads of code that does a thing. The sure result is an unprecedented increase in the amount of code in products.&lt;p&gt;A minor drawback to that enthusiasm is that a lot of the code I read didn't need to exist in the first place, even before this wave. Lots of it can be attributed to the path dependence of creation as opposed to what it is trying to do. This should be a rich time to change to security / exploit work - the random search tools are great and the target just keeps getting easier.&lt;p&gt;What our industry really desperately needed was to drive the quality of implementation right down. It's going to be an exciting time to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting topic that will, given this site's community, attract a lot of strong opinions.&lt;p&gt;I, for one, only decide whether CoPilot's productivity increase is worth the $10 it costs per month.&lt;p&gt;It doesn't really matter whether you're an employer getting a 3–30% increase in productivity or whether you pay for it personally and finish 2 hours faster every week and log off illegaly. It's easily worth its money. What more to consider?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've used Copilot and chatGPT to help with algorithms where I'm unsure where to start.  Actual case: "Write a performant algorithm to find the number of work days given a future date".  It's trickier than you think and makes a great interview question.&lt;p&gt;Both AI tools came back with...garbage.  Loops within loops within loops as they iterated through each day to check if the day is a weekend or not, is a leap year and to account for the extra day, is it a holiday or not, etc.&lt;p&gt;However, chatGPT provided a clever division to cut the dataset down to weeks, then process the result.  I ended up using that portion in my final algorithm creation.&lt;p&gt;So, my take on AI coding tools are: "Buyer beware.  Your results may vary".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters what you measure. The studies only looked at Copilot usage.&lt;p&gt;I’m an experienced engineer. Copilot is worse than useless for me. I spend most of my time understanding the problem space, understanding the constraints and affordances of the environment I’m in and thinking about the code I’m going to write app. When I start typing code, I know what I’m going to write, and so a “helpful” Copilot autocomplete is just distraction for me. It makes my workflow much much worse.&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, AI is incredibly useful for all of those steps I do before actually coding. And sometimes getting the first draft of something is as simple as a well crafted prompt (informed by all the thinking I’ve done prior to starting. After that, pairing with an LLM to get quick answers for all the little unexpected things that come up is extremely helpful.&lt;p&gt;So, contrary to this report, I think that if experienced developers use AI well, they could benefit MORE than inexperienced developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that over time, AI will tend to make all programmers into average programmers.&lt;p&gt;For those who are beginners, it can bring their skills up and make them look like better developers than they are.&lt;p&gt;More insidiously, expert programmers who overuse of AI might also regress to the mean as their skills deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be super productive at the raw keyboard. Then RSI got to me. But with CoPilot, I’m back to my normal productivity. For me it’s a life-saver as it allows fast typing with minimal hand strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT and to a lesser degree Copilot have been very valuable to me this year.&lt;p&gt;Copilot often saves me a lot of typing on a 1-3 line scope, occasionally surprising me with exactly what I was about to write on a 5-10 line scope.  It’s really good during rearrangement and early refactoring (as you are building a new thing and changing your mind as you go about code organization).&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT, or “Jimmy” - as I like to call him - has been great for answering syntax questions, idiom questions, etc. when applying my general skills based on other languages to ones I’m less familiar with.&lt;p&gt;It has also been good for “discussing” architecture approaches to a problem with respect to a particular toolset.&lt;p&gt;With proper guidance and very clear prompting, I usually get highly value responses.&lt;p&gt;I would rough guess that these two tools have saved me 2-3 months of solo time this year - nay, since April.&lt;p&gt;One I get down in the deep details, I use Jimmy much less often. But when I hit something new, or something I long since forgot, he’s ready to be relative expert / knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this appears to be great news.&lt;p&gt;However, there's a big question as to whether these are short productivity gains vs longer lasting gains. There's a hypothesis that the AI generate code will slowly spaghetti-fy a codebase.&lt;p&gt;Is 1-2 years sufficiently long enough to take this into consideration? Or disprove the spaghettification?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Notably, less experienced developers showed higher adoption rates and greater productivity gains.&lt;p&gt;And that is why demand for senior developers is going to go through the roof. Who is going to unfuck the giant balls of mud those inexperienced devs are slinging together? Who’s going to keep the lights on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It lets people make more PRs. Woohoo. Who cares?&lt;p&gt;Does it increase the number of things that pass QA?&lt;p&gt;Do the things done with AI assistance have fewer bugs caught after QA?&lt;p&gt;Are they easier to extend or modify later? Or do they have rigid and inflexible designs?&lt;p&gt;A tool that can help turn developers into unknown quality code monkeys is not something I’m looking for. I’m looking for a tool that helps developers find bugs or design flaws in what they’re doing. Or maybe write well designed tests.&lt;p&gt;Just counting PRs doesn’t tell me anything useful. But it triggers my gut feeling that more code per unit time = lower average quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt;Notably, less experienced developers showed higher adoption rates and greater productivity gains.&lt;p&gt;If you start low it's easier to get greater growth rates.&lt;p&gt;The biggest is the first step, 0% to 1% is infinite growth.&lt;/p&gt;

This study was authored by at least two folks &lt;i&gt;from Microsoft&lt;/i&gt; and one of the sample groups in the study was also &lt;i&gt;from Microsoft&lt;/i&gt;. The reason this seems to stand out to me as odd is that Microsoft also owns the AI tool being used in the study and would definitely want a favourable conclusion in this paper.&lt;p&gt;Is that a flag we should be watching out for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article you linked, "tetris-sql," appears to be using database extensions to overcome SQL's limitations. While the core SQL language itself is not Turing complete, these extensions, such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and procedural languages, can provide the necessary constructs for iterative execution and conditional logic.&lt;p&gt;By leveraging these extensions, the author has effectively created a Turing complete environment within the database system, allowing them to implement Tetris. However, it's important to note that the implementation would be more convoluted and less efficient compared to a traditional programming language designed for game development.&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the article is demonstrating how to create a Turing complete environment using SQL and its extensions, but it's not a direct representation of SQL's inherent capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome, great writeup.&lt;p&gt;I never attempted these kinds of things with postgresql, so it was very interesting to contrast the problems and solutions with SQLite, which I'm more familiar with [1].&lt;p&gt;If anyone is interested in more SQL Turing completeness, the Explain Extended blog is great [2].&lt;p&gt;[1]: &lt;a href="https://github.com/DanielFi/sqlite-vm/tree/feature/io"&gt;https://github.com/DanielFi/sqlite-vm/tree/feature/io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2]: &lt;a href="https://explainextended.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://explainextended.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think a general purpose programming language that was just SQL with some provisions for user input and rendering would be really cool. Having to model all your state relationally and implement all your logic declaratively ultimately leads to some very nice code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is awesome. I did linear regression in T-SQL once and it's a fun way to figure out what you can do with the language (eg - if you're unfamiliar with CTEs or cursors).&lt;p&gt;I'll definitely be checking this out later. Thanks for the post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems at first to be a toy or silly intellectual exercise, but after reading the whole thing it really feels like an example of how constraints can lead to creative solutions. Can't log to stdout in the recursive CTE's loop? Maybe `RAISE NOTICE` will work. Can't take user input from the query itself? What if we stored the input in a table locally and read from that instead with `dblink`?&lt;p&gt;It's just a lot of fun, kudos for hacking this together, this is the sort of thing that makes me love software so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool project! I remember I had coded a Reinforcement Learning (RL) assignment long ago back in college with just SQL (I was familiar with Oracle back then, so that's what I had used). The course instructor was amused, more so when he saw how loops were implemented: I had a "loop" table with a sequence of N numbers in a column, and used to join with it to "loop" N times!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;personally, this breaks the idea you need Sam to broker such funding. turns out, even the technical person, Ilya, can raise a billion dollars.&lt;p&gt;this is coming from someone who is not well-versed in fundraising and YC startup scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that vectorized linear algebra will be at the center of so much financial speculation?&lt;p&gt;There is a silver lining though. Even if it all goes to near-zero (most likely outcome for all VC investments anyway) the digital world will be one where fast matrix multiply is thoroughly commoditized.&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a trivial feat.&lt;p&gt;In a sense this will be the true end of the Wintel era. The old world of isolated, CISC, deterministic desktops giving way not to "AGI", but widely available, networked, vector "supercomputers" that can digest and transform practically everything that has ever been digitized.&lt;p&gt;Who knows what the actual (financial) winners of this brave new era will be.&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world there should be no winner-takes-all entity but a broad-based leveling up, i.e., spreading these new means of production as widely as possible.&lt;p&gt;Heck, maybe we will even eventually see the famously absent productivity gains from digital tech?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups used to be started on a few thousand, few hundred thousand of 'friends and family' seed capital.

&lt;p&gt;It's incredible that "LLM scam" or "LLM grift" is still going on. They are doing everything to not lose those $200 bln, but it's gone. It's went into heat, gone gone. 
Anyone talking about "infinite value when AGI" needs to take a break. 
There is no such thing and if anyone's saying such "non-smart" things, means THEY HAVE NOTHING. And they understand nothing or are lying to you, and/or are invested in this scam and scared of losing it all. 
One example: Even if/when there is AGI, so what? 
What more could AGI tell about you so you could "buy more stuff" or "make you better"? 
Not much. So it's still personal data where bigger value lies. 
This BS has to end. I'm fed up. (We are.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CFO's here, let's say I raise a round like that. What do you do with $1B in cash to manage it in the short and near term though? Is it just stuck in the money market or t-bills or what? Even if the growth of the company is the main bet, that cash has to exist as something with a better return than cash.&lt;p&gt;I assume that service is what SV bank provided before it tanked, but someone has to manage that cash for the few years it takes to burn through it. What kind of service do you park that in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn't very interesting itself, IMO, but it implies that they have something to sell investors. I wonder what it is. I kinda do understand that some bullshit elevator-pitch about how "we are the best" or even a name (Musk) is unfortunately sometimes enough in VC to invest vast amounts of money, but I don't know if it really happens often, and I hope there's more than that. So if there is more than that, I wonder what it is. What does Sutskever&amp;Co have now that OpenAI doesn't, for example?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone here is assuming that a very large LLM is their goal. 5 years ago, transformer models were not the biggest hype in AI. Since they apparently have a 10 year plan, we can assume they are hoping to invent one or two of the "big steps" (on the order of invention of transformer models). "SSI" might look nothing like GPT\d.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ilya is basically building the Tandem Computers of AI.&lt;p&gt;Before Tandem, computers used to fail regularly. Tandem changed that forever (with a massive reward for their investors).&lt;p&gt;Similarly, LLMs are known to fail regularly. Until someone figures out a way for them not to hallucinate anymore. Which is exactly what Ilya is after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being ycombinator and as such ostensibly has one or two (if not more) VCs as readers/commentators …  can someone please tell me how these companies that are being invested in in the AI space are going to make returns on the money invested? What’s the business plan? (I’m not rich enough to be in these meetings) I just don’t see how the returns will happen.&lt;p&gt;Open source LLMs exist and will get better. Is it just that all these companies will vie for a winner-take-all situation where the “best” model will garner the subscription? Doesn’t OpenAI make some substantial part of the revenue for all the AI space? I just don’t see it. But I don’t have VC levels of cash to bet on a 10x or 100x return so what do I know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also (if the valuation of 5 bio is to be trusted) a tentative answer to the question of Ilya's++ relative AI worth to the market at this point: A lot lower than hn and tech inclined spaces wanted to give him credit for during the past OpenAI turbulences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure all the points are correct but the assessment for ways forward being to just use TSMC as the manufacturer completely ignores the somewhat perilous position Taiwan is in with a looming Chinese invasion. I'd be very reluctant to tie the future of my business to the fates of a company that may become state property within a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the article, “William Shockley, one of the inventors of the transistor at Bell Labs”.&lt;p&gt;William Shockley did not invent the transistor in 1947. He was not on the patent and was in Europe at the time of the invention. John Bardeen and Walter Brattain were on the patent. Shockley shared the Nobel Prize due to work in 1948 on the transistor effect.&lt;p&gt;Source:

&lt;p&gt;yeah intel's foundry business might not be competitive in the short term. but it's better than nothing. they can focus on other industries that don't need high performance / for low power.&lt;p&gt;because if you yield the whole thing to tsmc. you won't be able to recover the expertise, which is catastrophic for both intel / USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally like Stratechery but this is not up to the usual standard.&lt;p&gt;To the extent that CISC means anything it means “backwards compatible”. Modern ARM cores have multi-step decode and issue: to the extent that RISC means anything it means “we developed this with twenty year’s hindsight so we don’t have to do a lot in microcode yet.” In die area, in TDP, in wafer consumption, it’s just not a big cost.&lt;p&gt;To the extent that Intel missed AI so did everyone: right now there’s one target and that’s NVIDIA, no amount of HBM/TC ratio tuning is going to change that. Like 3 of 17 Ray/Anyscale tutorials target Habana. The Gaudi stuff works fine if you’re willing to pay the “last year’s model” tax all non-CUDA does.&lt;p&gt;And bigger picture, on semiconductors it’s the geopolitics people who are watching the bright line: semiconductors are a major power arena, the markets will get adjusted along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sidequest:&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to do Windows and then I’m going to do Windows Mobile and I’m going to do Windows embedded.” (all on intel x86)&lt;p&gt;As someone who worked on Windows Mobile and Windows Embedded, it's funny because that's what management was hoping, but it was so different. I don't think any of the phones had an x86 chip in them, although that was our debugging setup so we could use vastly more powerful desktop machines as devkits (although we still had devices to). Having to port parts of Windows to ARM and even MIPS was a giant PITA.&lt;p&gt;Windows Embedded is closer since it was based on XP, but also a completely different branch from what I remember from Win Mobile.&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think it's easy to port things, and hard to write things. With really, really complicated software, it's still really hard just to port things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard the theory that Intel is physically incapable of doing the lithography transition they need to do without missing at least one full release cycle. Which should be bad news but shouldn’t be existential.&lt;p&gt;The theory goes that any CEO who does the necessary thing will be fired, so either they won’t do it, or the board will replace them with someone who won’t do it.&lt;p&gt;That kind of market failure can destroy arbitrary value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; today AMD has both better designs and, thanks to the fact they fab their chips at TSMC, better processes&lt;p&gt;On paper AMD is better, but in the scientific community, it seems  that Intel has much better performance for things like NumPy and SciPy. The reason seems to be "Intel® MKL" (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_Kernel_Library&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;p&gt;I'm using a lot of weasel words like "seems to" because I haven't rigorously proved it. But anecdotally, my company's AI pipelines which are NumPy/SciPy heavy run an order of magnitude faster (2 seconds vs. 20 seconds) on my laptop's Intel i7 than the do on my Ryzen 7, despite the Ryzen 7 being a newer gen than the i7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2021, Gelsinger named 22-year Intel vet Sandra Rivera to head up a new Datacenter and AI Group. Rivera, who spent two years as Intel’s chief people officer before taking on her new role, describes what Intel staffers are looking to get out of their relationship with the company, using terms that would have been unlikely to come up in its original heyday. “For sure, we are in an age now where our employees are looking for a deeper, richer connection to the purpose of the organization,” she says. “They care about diversity, equity, inclusion. They care about the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a trade lawyer but as I understand it, WTO treaty obligations specifically forbid the kind of purchase guarantees that Ben's arguing for here. Part of the whole point of the WTO is to to pull up the ladder and prevent countries from doing what Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan successfully did to become rich. So this kind of support for domestic manufacturers is not allowed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Altera merger pain is maybe enlightening.&lt;p&gt;Altera 10-series FPGAs were massively delayed due to Intel's 10 nm fab problems.  But I speculate that there was also a big difference in toolchains, does anyone know for sure?  I mean Altera was using TSMC previously, and I presume were using industry standard tools: Cadance / Synopsis.  But I would guess Intel was running their fab on home-grown tools...  what is the status these days?  For example I know for sure that IBM's synthesis was "Booledozer".&lt;p&gt;It's interesting because maybe Intel will spin out the fab business.  But are they immediately ready to become a commercial fab business instead an Intel-only business?  What's the toolchain like for Intel fab?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OP makes a compelling case that Intel's foundry operations have fallen so far behind that they are no longer economically viable on their own, in the face of current market forces, i.e., Intel's foundry business may not be able to earn a positive return on the tens of billions of dollars of capex now required to catch up with TSMC.&lt;p&gt;If the US truly views having a domestic foundry as critical to national security, the US federal government has no choice but to pay up big time to support Intel's foundry business until -- hopefully, eventually -- that business is able to compete profitably against TSMC to manufacture chips for Apple, Nvidia, AMD, etc.&lt;p&gt;Oh, how the mighty have fallen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I buy the thesis entirely (that thesis most aptly being: "Gelsinger does have one fatal flaw: he still believes in Intel, and I no longer do.")&lt;p&gt;The biggest reason is geopolitics: If escalated confrontation happens with China, Intel becomes one of the most valuable companies on the planet, period. TSMC will finish western fabs eventually, but the delta-t on when they become competitive (tech, capacity &amp; cost, remember) with even Intel's western fabs is... decades, plural? Maybe never? The CHIPS act helped, but TSMC is dragging their feet for very, very (existentially) good reason. Also, remember that TSMC is built entirely on the back of ASML; conflict with China doesn't just block the west's access to the east's fab capacity, it blocks the east's access to the west's tooling to build more and better fabs. TSMC craters in this scenario. Samsung also exists. That's the list of near-SotA fab capacity, globally.&lt;p&gt;Capacity is another good reason: TSMC is not a bottomless bucket, and every year for the past at least two years Apple has purchased 100% of their SotA fab capacity. No one is competing with Apple's margins (except Nvidia, but that's a bubble market; numbered days). His argument is that there's no market reason for Intel's fabs to exist; we don't have the data to say for certain, but I'd guess that if Intel went to TSMC and said "you're already making lunar lake, make our xeon chips too" TSMC would say "we can't" (especially on SotA nodes, but maybe even near-SotA). They're tapped out, they grow, they're instantly tapped out again, everyone wants what they're selling. Intel fabs Lunar Lake and Arc with TSMC; both very-low volume.&lt;p&gt;Also worth keeping in mind: Intel was at one time the global leader in chip fabrication; but they lost that crown. People view TSMC as this unassailable beast, but they're just as fallible; and when I hear people say "Well, Intel 18A is probably three years out and by that time we'll have TSMC N2P with backside power delivery so who will even care about Intel 18A" are just extrapolating history. That's a dangerous game when all these rankings and valuations are based on asymptotically approaching the limits of the laws of physics. And while it is unlikely that Intel will take the lead again, TSMC showing any sign of faltering will raise the relative value of the #2 companies.&lt;p&gt;Intel is not in a good spot, but they're still an interesting business, they're still designing some of the best chips on the planet, and with the right decisions could grow to be even better than interesting. IMO, this article is missing a lot of the hard analysis and data that Stratechery is usually known for; I don't feel you can have a researched discussion on Intel without talking about fabrication volume or their concerning levels of debt, but he didn't mention either of those things. Heck, more than one passing mention of China feels kinda important to the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens to the computer and tech industry if Intel fails?&lt;p&gt;The x86 licence still has value to some others in the space, but it seems like Intel could potentially be sold off for parts if it can't sell correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intel was getting something like $20 billion from the CHIPS act - but it seems like by the time the fabs would have been ready TSMC will already have them beat to 1.4nm/a14 (also using High NA EUV). Intel has just consistently failed to execute whereas TSMC has been fairly close to schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt;Their pay in the Bay Area is double tsmc in taiwan for equivalent roles in raw dollar terms but the ppp differences means your better off working for tsmc in Taiwan than intel in the Bay Area. That’s not a joke. Intel are literally incapable of attracting talent from Taiwan right now.&lt;p&gt;There's some whiplash in hearing constantly how the US is a corporate-dominated oligarchy, and then also seeing trillion-dollar industries at the forefront of the global economy constantly getting their shit rocked by a few dozen NIMBY retirees at city council meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if Global Foundries will become relevant again on the high end. They “gave up,” but they are working on some pretty small nodes now, 12nm, obviously not what TSMC is up to, but maybe they’ll catch Intel in 10 years. I’m sure they are fine for automotive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article mentions 26 constants but it seems there is more than that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_physical_constants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I think if the constant is a ratio, like the fine structure constant, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant&lt;/a&gt; no change can be detected, even if there were a change because the ratio will stay the same. Likewise a constant like pi will stay the same because it is a ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like a case of premature naming to me! If we have to test whether or not they change, they shouldn't already be called "constants".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This always seems like a logical error to me and perhaps someone can explain:&lt;p&gt;To measure a constant, you need something constant, but you do not know if something is constant if you do not have something constant to measure it against. (False premise?)&lt;p&gt;I believe we can only assume things are constant, but they only appear constant.&lt;p&gt;I you read the work of the physicist Julian Barbour regarding time I think you will be in for some remarkable insights.

&lt;p&gt;I think you might mean the one _electron_ conjecture. It’s fun because you have anti-electrons whose Feynman diagrams look like electrons going backwards in time. So you could conceivably be observing the tangled world line of a single electron bouncing back and forward in time — sometimes observing it as an antielectron.&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t work with photons because there’s not an anti-photon.&lt;p&gt;Anyway it’s sort of a fun “woah!” moment that Feynman was so good at producing, but I don’t think it’s taken particularly seriously as a theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Lots of nuclei have similar spin transitions, but only in thorium-229 is this cancellation so nearly perfect.
&gt; 
&gt; “It’s accidental,” said Victor Flambaum(opens a new tab), a theoretical physicist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. “A priori, there is no special reason for thorium. It’s just experimental fact.” But this accident of forces and energy has big consequences.&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;&gt; Physicists have developed equations to characterize the forces that bind the universe, and these equations are fitted with some 26 numbers called fundamental constants. These numbers, such as the speed of light or the gravitational constant, define how everything works in our universe. But lots of physicists think the numbers might not actually be constant.&lt;p&gt;Putting these things together, if the physical constants do change over time, then perhaps there really isn't anything special about thorium-229, it's just that it's the one where the electrical repulsion and strong nuclear forces balance out right now.  In a billion years maybe it would be some other element.  Maybe we're just lucky to be alive at a time when one of the isotopes of an existing element just happens to line up like this.&lt;p&gt;Perhaps too there's an optimal alignment that will happen or has already happened when those forces exactly balance out, and maybe that would be an ideal time (or place, if these constants vary by location) to make precise measurements in the changes to these constants, much like a solar eclipse was an ideal opportunity for verifying that light is bent by gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If fundamental constants could change, this would violate energy conservation, and the second law of thermodynamics. Someone once said, if your pet theory violates the second law, there is no hope. Or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's assume they manage to make a nuclear clock out of this, with an Allan drift that's low enough to be useful. Once that's done, it'll take years of observation to measure any meaningful differences and gather enough data to notice something.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, moving the height of anything a centimeter, the position of the moon, and a whole other host of noise sources have to be canceled out.&lt;p&gt;I have no doubt this will be done... and it will be awe inspiring to hear it all told after the fact.&lt;p&gt;While you're waiting... I found this really cool meeting documented on YouTube[1] that has the clearest explanation of how Chip Scale Atomic clocks work I've ever seen.&lt;p&gt;I look forward to Chip Scale Optical Lattice clocks&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHYvS7MtBok" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHYvS7MtBok&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still something of an open question whether or not G is actually constant.&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but the results differ depending on whether atomic or dynamical time is used! In the latter case no change is measured using lunar reflectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matter in other galaxies would behave differently from matter in the Milky Way if fundamental constants are not always true. I argue about this sometimes. Others keep stating that the wavelengths are equal, so everything else must be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Dynamicland/Realtalk and its ethos have tended to strike me as... pretentious, to say the least, the 2024 video has a key quote that really resonates with how I've been thinking about software lately:&lt;p&gt;"Anything you can make an interpreter for is a program."&lt;p&gt;Thinking of data not as something to be processed &lt;i&gt;by&lt;/i&gt; code, but as code in and of itself, is one of those mindsets that pops up independently in various circles, but a lot of mainstream programming styles and tools and techniques seem to be borderline antithetical to that sort of mindset.  I think the recent renaissance-of-sorts of AI might help contribute to making code/data equivalence more mainstream, since that seems to be how your average AI model operates: as a bunch of neurons that encode code and data as a single blob.  Unfortunately, that "blob" tends to be opaque and inscrutable; I wouldn't be surprised if the next big leap in software engineering coincides with bringing data-as-code-friendly programming environments into the mainstream, such that said inscrutable blobs could be made, well, scrutable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Bret keeps Dynamicland and Realtalk so closed to others while touting it as “more open than open source” is really frustrating.&lt;p&gt;I get it. Opening it up means losing control. I really appreciate the desire to specifically not share it on traditionally engineer-centric spaces like GitHub as that will skew the vision towards engineering and possibly shut out non-programmers. I even get that Dynamicland isn’t really code that can be shared anyway.&lt;p&gt;But you have to give people something more than a general description and a vague invitation to visit your space. Otherwise it isn’t really open at all.&lt;p&gt;Some ideas:&lt;p&gt;- A document for how to experiment with domain exploration using tangibles and people in a way that leverages insights gleaned from Dynamicland&lt;p&gt;- A codebase for a “toy” computational system (named completely differently from Realtalk/Dynamicland so it’s clear that it is not actually part of Dynamicland) that shows how it’s possible to link physical properties to computational agents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't want to watch videos while at work so had to do it with the text, and trying to figure out what it was was hard. First thing I encountered a few times was this sentence:&lt;p&gt;"An independent nonprofit research lab, whose mission is to enable universal literacy in a humane dynamic medium."&lt;p&gt;That said literally NOTHING about what this project is.&lt;p&gt;Only later on I found this text:&lt;p&gt;"The entire website is made in Realtalk, which means that everything on it physically exists. (Even this sentence.) It’s not a rendering of a virtual space — it’s a real place."&lt;p&gt;And FINALLY I sort of understood what the interesting thing here is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like Bret’s talks and I think Dynamicland is a great experiment which I’m happy to see moving forward. However in this video he came off less as an engineer and designer and more of a preacher. He seemed to care more about convincing people that his politics and ideas are just so gosh darn great without talking about any specifics. (When I say “politics” I mean more like “the nature of reality and the role of humans”, not Red vs Blue.) I would really like to hear more about how Realtalk actually works. It seems like there are several glaring problems that Bret has either solved or is at least working on, but he doesn’t talk about the solutions much. (Indicator collision, portability of indicators between Dynamicland instances, and debugging are just a few off the top of my head.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has gone a long way from the first demos, but in a way it kind of fell back to a fairly standard model of computing: ie this looks like a reactive visual programming environment with a real-world user interface sitting on top of it.&lt;p&gt;Looking at the demos, the real world objects look mostly like standard user input on a computer (knobs, buttons, textarea, pointers, etc.) - using actually 3d printed models of houses in a wind simulation is fun, but would you print another house for each iteration of the design? what's the point here? - and the papers laid out really are Observable cells.&lt;p&gt;This aimed to be some kind of paradigm change, but it just ends up being Excel-on-a-table.&lt;p&gt;Being a fan of Excel/Observable myself, I see it as something great though, just not ground-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels like something you could get a whole lot more traction and experimentation in quickly if it also existed as a room in something like VRChat or added to people's rooms in a VR passthrough mode. You'd lose some of the benefits of being in a shared physical space but you would also lose some of the limitations around the tracking resolution and stability of the fiducial markers on the page and open it up to people who can't make it to the location in person.&lt;p&gt;A 2.0 version could even merge the two versions slightly, tracking irl people into the virtual space (with pose and position estimates?) and programs (? I don't know the lingo off hand, but I mean the paper sheets everything revolves around) and in the opposite direction project the programs from VR onto the real table.&lt;p&gt;I've been interested in it for years so I'm very glad to see it's still moving forwards and alive. There were years where I couldn't find any actual new information coming out of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what an important set of ideas. if I'm interpreting correctly it's an instance of a pattern language for organizing people aided by tech. the idea seems to have moved past the constraints of goal oriented methodologies and on to modular blocks of logic for coordination.&lt;p&gt;i wonder if a coarse analogy for it might include roberts rules in a related category of ideas, and then with some concepts from tech around versioning and then it's something else entirely, but they seem to approach some of the same coordination problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those criticizing, think of this updated website more from the lens of art, less pragmatics. The Doug Engelbart "Mother of All Demos" functioned in this way as well. Can you imagine scoffing at Engelbart in the same way? There are quite a few deep ideas in this presentation of Dynamicland, many of which are subtle and take some effort to find and appreciate, much like art.&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is intended to be useful to many one day, and they claim it "actually works" _now_, but if you read carefully (and you should!), they are trying very hard to maintain (and gradually grow) a beautiful little flame of a vision. PARC, on the other hand, had 10 years. Afterwards, industry ran with the ideas they wanted, and Alan Kay has been beating the "you missed the big ideas!" drum since. The Dynamicland group is trying to learn from this lesson of history.&lt;p&gt;Kudos to the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kudos to Bret and all the best to the communal computing community (pun intended) hopefully this takes the cyber physical system including IoT and machine-to-machine to another (useful) level.&lt;p&gt;&gt;Anyone can change any program at any time, and see the changes immediately&lt;p&gt;Not sure what programming language Bret implementing the system but recently there's discussion how difficult and how slow to parse/compile some of the popular programming languages including C++ and Rust. In this case D is a unique anomaly where it has immediate rdmd  REPL facility although it's a complex and a compiled language [1].&lt;p&gt;For creative, inventive, intuitive and comprehensive programming cyber physical system that involve hardware with fast sensing, control and immediate responses, D language is hands down the best programming there is [2].

&lt;p&gt;I think the cool part about this is that you can easily build a user interface from physical objects, so you can skip some of the digital frontend and design and focus more on the computational backend. This frees you up for more explorative, improvised coding, which is great for research and art but maybe also many other situations where fixed user interfaces get into the way too much. Based on what they show about their biology lab project, it seems to be surprisingly useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder whether someone already has build away to create modular synthesizer using block with knobs on the table. A line on the top of the knob would signal its position. (In the video I saw some shots that looked like sequencers.) You would also need some mechanism to connect the modules together. I played around with VCV Rack [1], but adjusting knobs with a mouse feels very different than using your hands to turn a physical knob. Also, I would like to have more freedom in arranging modules more freely as you could do on a table, instead of using patch cables that go into all kinds of directions. Especially for newbies, it would be an interesting way to see if they want to go into real modular synths based on Eurorack [2], AE Modular [3] or microrack [4].&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://vcvrack.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://vcvrack.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[2] &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[3] &lt;a href="https://www.tangiblewaves.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.tangiblewaves.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;[4] &lt;a href="https://microrack.org/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://microrack.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking things about this for me is how clearly it demonstrates the fact that community and sharing are not the same thing.&lt;p&gt;Building tools that enable communities to share effectively seems like another additional challenge, and the fact that virtual spaces and digital spaces are dismissed seems like it might prove a major roadblock to connecting and sharing in a larger inclusive community.&lt;p&gt;Given the interest in leveraging this for doing science it also seems that this is at risk for empowering individual labs while leaving all interfaces to the rest of the larger scientific community dependent on the current utterly broken system of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can totally relate. There are some relatively modern processors though that still support the old but gold S3 state. The i5-1240P and i7-1260P processors support these, but not all manufacturers integrate UEFI support for this sleep state. I found that Dasharo offers the ability to switch to S3: &lt;a href="https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-features/#power-management-options" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.dasharo.com/dasharo-menu-docs/dasharo-system-fe...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn't seem to have this problem yet so took a look at my recent machines:
     cat /sys/power/mem_sleep&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    starlite mkv 0yo Intel(R) N200, has deep.
    framework0   2yo Intel 12th gen, has deep.
    framework1   1yo AMD Ryzen 5, lacking deep!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
That explains it—I haven't really taken the last one out of the house yet.&lt;p&gt;So what can we do about this?  Can we start a class action lawsuit for breaking the PC?  Probably too late to return the AMD.&lt;p&gt;Finally I recommend calling S0ix/s2idle nap, and leave s3 as sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is one of the reasons I've always preferred Hybernate over sleep.&lt;p&gt;More reliable even if it does take just a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never opened up my laptop thinking: oh I wish my new emails were already there.&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly when I enable S3 on my P1 Gen 5 Windows 11 give me a whole bunch of warnings in the security center.&lt;p&gt;Seems like S3 itself is incompatible with some modern firmware protections.&lt;p&gt;But frankly, I don't care whether it's S0 or S3. I just want it to sleep, and I don't want the OS to NOT offer me the options to say 'don't do stuff in sleep mode'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One aspect I've yet to see covered is how existing hardware doesn't seem to be designed for s0ix to work as intended anyway.&lt;p&gt;For example, on mobile phones it used to be the case that the application processor wasn't actually the main processor of the phone, it was actually the baseband, and relatedly, this meant that the application processor could be shutdown and woken up when the phone received a text message or phone call. Similarly, modern arm processors have a big/little configuration where you can switch to the efficiency cores when the system is asleep.&lt;p&gt;While I'm aware that at some point intel started offering efficiency cores, the vast majority of devices that run windows, AFAIK, don't have any way of being awake in sleep mode other that just leaving the CPU running with the screen off.&lt;p&gt;Maybe s0ix will make more sense as big.LITTLE and other secondary CPU schemes become common, but today seems like it's just upsetting existing users for no apparent gain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "fun" part is that smartphones/tablets implement those features with S3 (CPU off, RAM in self-refresh).&lt;p&gt;Updates? Well here is an RTC to wake-up. Voice control? Well here is an always on audio dsp. Remote wake-up? Well here is a WiFi frame filter to trigger IRQ.&lt;p&gt;I think it isn't tractable on most laptops because of all the hardware that has been onloaded to software, and the hardware isn't capable of those hardware filtering, and partly OS and drivers are probably to blame too. An embesded OS takes under 1s to wakeup, so even managing TCP KeepAlives wih resume/suspend is realistic on those devices. Not so much when wakeup takes 10s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laptop manufacturers on their own clearly didn't hurt this (dying) category enough over the years prioritizing shallow form over functionality and constant design regressions, Microsoft had to push some more of their deranged "vision" too. S0ix was a joke when introduced years ago and remains one, but it's not funny to laugh at it anymore because its existence eventually killed the actual &lt;i&gt;sleep&lt;/i&gt; state an user expects. There is, without an ounce of doubt, no benefit for an user to have their laptop device continue operating when it's expected to be "sleeping" without intentional, conscious instruction to resume work. Some of the proclaimed advantages to it I distinctly remember were "receiving emails" and "automatic updates when the device is not in use", and while the former is mostly useless because it's not a smartphone, the latter is actively harmful to an user's interests when unprompted. Hibernation on linux and windows (where it's secretly kept away for whatever reason since 8 or so) is far more predictable with any modern sabotaged devices missing S3 support, and modern drives are performant and large enough that it's not going to make much of a difference, at least for pauses that one expects to last more than an hour or two. Some more of the endless compromises to put up with because of unrestrained "courage".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds totally nuts. I guess I’m happy to be running a laptop where when I close the lid, it will sleep and have battery when I open the lid, in an hour or in 2 days. I thought that was the basic requirement for being a laptop? The essential feature. It’s so surprising to hear things have gone backwards in the Windows world.&lt;p&gt;My suggestion to anyone dealing with annoying power management is to get a MacBook Pro (you can get tons of ram, we are ordering 96gb models for our engineers) and run your preferred OS in a full screen VM if you don’t like MacOS. I did this for years because I don’t trust Linux to manage battery or reliably pair with Bluetooth devices (especially Bluetooth audio), but I much preferred Linux window management and access to Docker.&lt;p&gt;Parallels runs Windows quite well, and either that, Virtualbox, or the various apps that are thin layers over the system Hypervisor.framework all do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big reasons that I moved to MacOS in ~2004 was that, at that time, for reasonable money you couldn't get a laptop that had any sort of reliably sensible sleep behaviour in Linux, and even Windows was iffy. The iBook had no such issues.&lt;p&gt;It's somewhat surprising that this is still the case, 20 years later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your computer should be able to allow for the usage of Cortana and receive Windows Updates during Sleep mode, among other features.”&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, I've spent many hours on DELLs trying to solve S0ix sleep states... What a pain in the butt that is. There are few major pain points:&lt;p&gt;1) Every component has to be in the right "state of mind" in order for Si0x sleep to work properly. Do you have shitty NVMe that has buggy PCI powersaving? Too bad, battery will drain 10%/hour. Your yubikey keeps USB bus by constantly sending interrupts? Ha, enjoy your new backpack heater and watch out for fires...&lt;p&gt;2) It is extremely hard to debug these issues. I've figure out the yubikey and few things, but some of them are esoterical! ifconfig eth0 down = some part of Intel AMT stops sleeping and is now fully on all the time. Why? Because f&lt;i&gt;ck you, that's why. If you want to get some debug info, you can get some very cryptic state-flags for (some) components and you really have to guess what these really are - there is no documentation unfortunately.&lt;p&gt;3) UEFI is a mess - one would say that you want critical component, such as BIOS/boot chain to be as simple as possible and &lt;/i&gt;not* to be extensible in nature - because if some malicious code manages to get in the UEFI modules, you are simply hosed. But the other problem is that UEFI provides quite a lot of interfaces through ACPI and ACPI tables are buggy as hell. I had to patch DELL's DSDT tables in order to get back "deep" sleep - unfortunately it stopped working some time ago as they must have changed something somewehere and the computer would not wake up anymore... It is impossible to debug (or rather it is a royal pain to debug).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; But in Contrast, Apple kept the legacy Lightning and even brought back Magsafe (and if it only were to milk the cashcow).&lt;p&gt;I don’t quite understand this line. Are they talking about Lightning or MagSafe with the parenthetical? MagSafe specifically is something users were begging them to bring back and they did it without removing USB-C charging (best of both worlds).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without getting technical about it... my previous work laptop (2019 vintage) when suspended, would blink a light until unsuspended - hours or days later - with still usable battery capacity left.&lt;p&gt;The current one.  Fold it shut, stick it in my backpack.  No noticeable powering-up or overheating issues, but if it's more than a few hours, the thing has a drained battery and is fully shut down.  Luckily Windows "fast startup" mitigates the pain - it doesn't take very long for it to unsuspend-from-disk and reach a usable state again, with apps still open etc.  No idea what Linux would do here.  I actually have Linux on my previous work laptop (Elitebook 840 G6) and "proper" suspend works just fine on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having owned countless Mac notebooks over the last 30 years — starting from the PowerBook 140 up through the M1 MacBook Pro — I can tell you with confidence that Apple has made the same sleep change shenanigans mentioned in OP’s article.&lt;p&gt;It used to be that you could count on a sleeping Mac to stay asleep until you explicitly woke it up by opening the lid, pressing a key on the keyboard, or pressing the trackpad (or separate trackpad buttons — yes, those used to exist). Perhaps more importantly, you could count on the sleep function to have barely any effect on the Mac battery.&lt;p&gt;I don’t recall when, but at some point over the aforementioned three decades, Apple started changing the terms of this sleep contract.&lt;p&gt;It seems Apple decided that some functions should still be available when the Mac is “sleeping”, with no way to restore the previous behavior. As a result, random wake-ups are the new normal, replete with unexpected battery drainage.&lt;p&gt;I have seen modern MacBooks go to “sleep” with an 80% charge at night, only to be rendered dead with a 0% battery level by morning. Does something this extreme happen often? No. But it &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; happened before. And moderate battery loss while sleeping? That happens &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; often on today’s MacBooks.&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may very. And Apple probably continues to implement better computer sleep behavior than competing vendors. But I would argue that people who think MacBook sleep behavior is excellent… have never experienced how it behaved in the past. &lt;i&gt;That&lt;/i&gt; behavior was superb.&lt;p&gt;But sadly, I imagine most people have never experienced that excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kinda telling how Google switched to S0(s2idle) on Android since Pixel 3 or 4, fixed up most of their own drivers, submitted fixes to mainline (and probably to firmware developers too) and a few years later every Android device uses S0 and sleeps flawlessly.&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile MS have been trying to do the same since 2012 and there are still numerous issues.&lt;p&gt;I'm just glad my Lenovo Legion still uses S3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has frustrated me too. I've completely avoided using sleep these days, and instead use hibernate.&lt;p&gt;Bizarrely, Microsoft also wants to hide this option from you too. But it still exists and modern SSDs are extremely fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm always amazed by the tales of people who seemingly use sleep mode on the laptops without issues. In my experience every time I try this trick the laptop wakes up on its own in my backpack and turns into a heatbomb. This reliably reproduces on all half a dozen laptops I've used over past decade or more. So I was kinda trained to always turning off laptops for transporting.&lt;p&gt;Is sleep really fixed and finally can be used on Windows? Do you tweak power settings or configs for that in any way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've both bought and sold my ReMarkable 2.&lt;p&gt;I bought it before they added a subscription, so I was spared the pain.&lt;p&gt;For me personally, it was too expensive to be able to just use the device and not worry about damaging it, I even stopped wearing a watch, because I worried that it might scratch the display.&lt;p&gt;I don't have that worry with a notebook, but then again, notebook is physically limited especially when compared to digital tablets.&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy writing, so after I sold my unit, I went back to pen and paper, but I do still love the tech so I keep an eye on it!&lt;p&gt;Usually colour E-ink is slower than monochrome, I wonder what the product will actually look like and function, when it launches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first bought it, my Remarkable 2 was one of the very few pieces of technology (hardware &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; software) that I didn't actively dislike.&lt;p&gt;Then they started releasing software updates that made the UI slower, moved around the buttons in said UI, made it easy to accidentally select the wrong widgets (e.g. because two widgets are in the same part of the screen and so a double-tap combined with the high refresh latency causes a misinput), made notebook/page loading much slower (which, to their credit, they have fixed), and started adding lots of typing-related features that I don't use or need.&lt;p&gt;The device is still &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt;, but I still find myself getting annoyed at it in a way that I didn't when it was new - although for me that's my experience with virtually &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; technology.&lt;p&gt;I wish there was a tablet with similar ergonomics that allowed me to tinker with the guts. I want to be able to write Python or C against a simple API and immediately run my code - I don't want to have to write an Android application, which I think is necessary for the BOOXen? I just want to easily write code that processes my pen strokes in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it's not like my comment is important but saw my colleague really forcing himself to use his RM1 as though it was a gift. Never really understood the purpose of something that was less than 1% as capable as an iPad, even if it may feel better to write on. Sure the battery is probably great due to eInk but honestly my iPad is never out of battery or far from USB-C. I can play games on my iPad for 3hrs and only use 10% battery it's insane.&lt;p&gt;The only thing I will say is that for the iPad I'm still surprised I can't really share my screen and start drawing on a whiteboard in a Slack meeting which was my primary desire for having one. Literally be in a meeting and start sketching boxes and circles to my coworkers to explain things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to replace paper, devices have to compete with paper.  I keep paper and pen in every room in my house.  I am not going to buy a $600 device for every room in my house.  A device had better be very reliable and make offloading easy also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm in the market for something like this, but for sheet music. Something where I can upload PDF copies of music to a reader, annotate them with the stylus, and easily page through the music as part of a performance. I sing choir, so weight is a factor. My Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra is just a tad too heavy.&lt;p&gt;I read lots of discussions on comparable devices on this post, can anyone recommend something suitable for music?&lt;p&gt;On android I use MobileSheets which does everything I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks insteresting to me.&lt;p&gt;I did look at getting a RM2, but for the same price I could get a iPad with a pencil.

&lt;p&gt;Well... While I admire reMarkable in technical terms, I'll not buy a black box where I have to hack the box just to manage my system. I do not care much about handwriting recognition and other "cool solution to help the end user", I do care about no eye strain reading of LONG damn documents, where scrolling distract instead of help, and casual ability to draw things. Period.&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately they took a classic commercial path, maybe fueled by many "users desires" described by users who have not much an idea about how they can use such devices and the result is well... Not exiting especially for the price. I have no issue paying something I own, I do not pay for something I can only use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a reMarkable 2 that I use pretty regularly.  I have had the same pin nib breakage other folks have had, but ate the $130 to replace my pen.  Since that, I haven't had any issues.  It's generally a great device that I enjoy using, although I don't use it while I'm at home because I have my custom mechanical keyboard and can type much faster than I write in Standard Notes in Markdown.  Every time I take a trip though, I take my rM2 with me, and it's my primary on-the-go notetaking tool and I take a /lot/ of notes.&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of research and decided to go ahead and jump on the Paper Pro.  I hope it's worth it, because it's quite a bit more expensive than the rM2 was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for everyone's reference, there is a rich community of third-party packages [0] ("apps") and launchers for rM and rM2, so it's possible to add on any number of sync (syncthing), encryption (gocrpytfs), epub (koreader), web browsing (netsurf), vnc (vnsee), wacom driver and more. The user get's root shell access from the beginning, and you can automate all sorts of things using systemd and standard shell utilities.&lt;p&gt;The out-of-the-box software may be a bit barebones for some power users, but you can certainly add-on the functionality that you desire.&lt;p&gt;[0]: &lt;a href="https://toltec-dev.org/testing/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://toltec-dev.org/testing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iirc they still got the chance to appeal at supreme court, so we shall hear about this in a few quarters time.&lt;p&gt;personally, if you disconnect the rest of IA from the "CDL" aspect and look at the lawsuit this way, it seems to me like another instance where from legislative perspective, owning a digital copy of media remains inferior to owning the physical one. the affordances of the digital technologies has been used as a way to exploit the laws' interpretation.&lt;p&gt;AI is shaping up to be the next frontier of this matter, but we don't have a large player (with community focus and not big tech money) that could be tested as a scapegoat just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This appeal will further be appealed.  There are logical contradictions within the decision.  Further, the judges have come to a conclusion at the summary judgement phase that does not meet the basic criteria of looking at things in the light that best favors the defendant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish IA had not started this fight.  I love libraries, but it's totally unintuitive to me why it would have been OK to rent out unlimited digital copies of copywritten books.  Just from a policy perspective, that structure doesn't create the right incentives for authors and publishers to publish books.  It's a non-starter unless you make some broader societal change regarding how we fund writing.&lt;p&gt;IA does plenty of other awesome things - this felt like a waste of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;sigh&lt;/i&gt; Entirely avoidable, entirely predictable. It's time to talk about what happens next.&lt;p&gt;The Internet Archive must cost a fortune to run. There's no way they're going to get enough donation money if they &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; provide old website archives. Their "online library of everything" gambit was an attempt to boost their donations by attracting a wider audience.&lt;p&gt;They'll have to diminish the capabilities of the wayback machine in some way. I think they'll replace domain-based search with some kind of LLM-based conversational frontend, grabbing some funding from OpenAI or someone in the process.&lt;p&gt;It's too bad. I've been scraping the wayback machine ever since they did this stupid "pandemic library" and I noticed that they were allowing full movie and game rips with zero moderation. I'd like to have gotten a more complete archive, but what I have now is pretty good for my own uses. If you did the same, good job. If you didn't, well, I did warn you over and over ( &lt;a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=phendrenad2%20archive&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This decision is ridiculous.  It essentially codifies, once and for all, that buying a physical book conveys more rights than buying a digital book, to the buyer.  Previously this was de facto the case only because of DRM on the digital book, but this now makes it de jure, regardless of the presence of DRM.&lt;p&gt;By my take, the only correct action any right-thinking person can do is civil disobedience and work to archive, anonymously and for the public, as much written works as possible.  This is an absolute theft of the commons, and particularly heinous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I stockpile manuals and other guide books, and pirate as much as possible. The publishers don't really care about anything other than cash, even on media they haven't published or updated in decades. I will gladly buy self published and, small run media new, but everything else is used/second-hand. The abuse only stops when you set boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I to understand that it’s legal and okay for LLM providers to profit massively from training commercial models on copyrighted works, without the rights holders’ permission - but illegal, and unacceptable, for private individuals to access a digital library?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key findings and implications:&lt;p&gt;1. The court rejected IA's fair use defense, finding that its digital lending practices merely substitute for and do not transform the original copyrighted works.&lt;p&gt;2. IA's activities are likely to cause significant market harm to publishers' e-book and digital licensing businesses, which outweighs any public benefits of expanded access.&lt;p&gt;3. Allowing widespread unauthorized digital copying and distribution, even by a nonprofit, would undermine the fundamental purpose of copyright law to incentivize creative expression.&lt;p&gt;4. The ruling highlights the tension between expanding public access to knowledge and preserving authors' and publishers' exclusive rights over their works, which copyright law is meant to balance.&lt;p&gt;5. The decision sets an important precedent limiting the ability of digital libraries and archives to widely distribute copyrighted works online without permission, even if the intent is to increase public access.&lt;p&gt;-Kagi Sum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things will get worse before they're get better, but ultimately the publishers will pay dearly for this.&lt;p&gt;First, the IA should move to a more favorable copyright jurisdiction to preserve the collection.&lt;p&gt;Second, there's no point fighting the copyright lobby, especially so in the US. We need to build an alternative access to knowledge that bypasses the copyright/ownership of knowledge paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will this mean for other sites with similar programs? I know many libraries do similar "renting" of digital texts on their websites. I guess they will have to shut down these programs.&lt;p&gt;For instance, I know this is Canadian so different jurisdiction but here is an example of one: &lt;a href="https://montreal.ca/en/services/digital-book-loans" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://montreal.ca/en/services/digital-book-loans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not understand this. Why use a three-node Proxmox cluster to self-host services that would (generously) need one N100 (with straightforward LiIon battery backup)? Why all this complexity for a relatively barebone setup?&lt;p&gt;They aren’t even self-hosting their own files, relying on Wasabi instead, and I do not understand why. Surely there is an HDD somewhere between those three nodes in the Proxmox cluster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author mentions they use Komga for comics and calibre-web for ebooks. However I personally find the Komga is a much better eBook reader than calibre-web. I use it for all my books and works incredibly well on mobile. The only thing I don't like about Komga is the logo, which I simply replaced on my private instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No mention of how many terrible routes there are to residential ISPs? The packet loss you get as a home enthusiast service provider to points of presence around the country is abysmal. VPNs become a requirement for accessing these non-cloud services. Always a troll toll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used GCS (like S3 for GCP) for storing prometheus backups (via thanos) at $previous_job. That thing cost an arm and a leg for what it did (presumably, thanos was partially at fault but I didn't dig that much).&lt;p&gt;I moved to minio (in a GCP VM) and reduced our overall GCP bill by 70%. Yes, using cloud storage was 2/3 of the cost of our cloud infrastructure.&lt;p&gt;But overall, going too far in the self-hosted route has its costs. Hardware depreciation is one (and the author mentions UPS which seems huge in addition to being critical), cooling/powering, and of course the time for maintenance. If you are going this route you are doing this because you want to learn that stuff, not because you want to save the subscription. Otherwise, just use less services and keep price comparison lists updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are very few people or projects talk about actually backup and restore application data.&lt;p&gt;This is especially true the open source systems like truenas scale. Any turnkey selfhosting software that's not implement a robust backup restore system is essentially holding your data hostage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self hosting makes you realize how insanely expensive cloud providers are. AWS charging for IP4 addresses was the last straw for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is tangentally-related, but I feel it is very wrong that so many smaller governments (e.g. smaller US cities) host "public information" on private servers (e.g. links to PDFs from a Google Drive)... or &lt;i&gt;even worse&lt;/i&gt; inside some walled-garden (e.g. Facebook).&lt;p&gt;My own personal DNS does not resolve to any Google/Facebook products, reducing profiling; but by denying their ad-revenue, I also deny myself access to information which &lt;i&gt;IMHO should be truly available to the public&lt;/i&gt; (without using a private company's infrastructure).&lt;p&gt;I absolutely understand that many people will just say "don't block them, then." My argument is that governments should not host public items on private servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone tried those Lithium Ion UPSes?  ~5 years ago we removed the UPS from our dev/stg stack because in the previous 5 years we had more outages caused by the UPS than issues with the utility power.  A better battery technology sounds compelling.&lt;p&gt;For production, of course, it's all dual feed, generator, UPS with 10 year batteries, N+1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I self host too.&lt;p&gt;a couple points&lt;p&gt;- proxmox hits an SSD pretty hard, continuously.  I think with zfs, it probably hits even harder.  A lot of it is every second keeping state for a cluster, even if you have only one machine.&lt;p&gt;- I bought mikrotik routers for openwrt.  I tried out routeros, but it seemed to phone home.  So I got openwrt going and didn't look back.  I am switching to zyxel since you can have an openwrt switch with up to 48-ports.&lt;p&gt;- I used to run small things on a pi, but after getting proficient at proxmox, they've been moved to a vm or container.&lt;p&gt;- the most wonderful milestone in self-hosting was when I got vlans set up.  Having vlans that stayed 100% in the house was huge.&lt;p&gt;- next good milestone was setting up privoxy.  Basically a proxy with a whitelist.  All the internal vlan machines could update, but no nonsense.&lt;p&gt;- it is also nice to browse the web with a browser pointing at privoxy.  You'd be surprised at the connections your browser will make.  Firefox internally phones home all. the. time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One^W two things what makes self-hosting a bit more attractive:&lt;p&gt;a) besides the some bootstrapping nuances you are not &lt;i&gt;forced&lt;/i&gt; to have a working phone number to be able to use some resource. It's usually not a problem until... well until it became a problem. Just like for me yesterday when for whatever I tried but I couldn't register a new Google account. There is just &lt;i&gt;no other option than SMS confirmation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;b) there is way less things to change 'for your own convenience', like a quiet removal of any option to pre-pay for Fastmail.&lt;p&gt;PS oh and Dynadot (which I was happy using for more than 10 years) decided (for my convenience, of course) to change the security mechanism they used for years. Of course I don't remember the answer for the security question and now I forced to never ever migrate from them, because I literally can't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love this but I'd like to know more about the hardware.&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I find it amusing that commenters here say that they "self host" in the cloud. It ain't self hosting unless the server is under the same roof as the family!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with Christian about pretty much everything here. We self-host for multiple reasons, and we don't necessarily need others to necessarily understand our rationale, although that'd be nice.&lt;p&gt;For me, one thing that stands out as something driving the desire to self-host everything is that large corporations, given enough time, invariably let us down. Christian's experience with Contabo illustrates the one game that I will do any amount of work to avoid: people who pretend to know what they're talking about but who really only waste our time in hopes to put off dealing with an issue until someone else actually fixes it.&lt;p&gt;The one place where I can't avoid this truly stupid game is with getting and maintaining Internet for my clients. You're not paying for "enterprise", with "enterprise" pricing of $750 a month for 200 Mbps? Then tough cookies - you'll get the same junk we force on our residential customers, and you'll never, &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; be able to talk to a human who has any clue what you're talking about, but you'll be able to talk to plenty who'll pretend to know and will waste hours of your time.&lt;p&gt;The more time they waste of mine, the more energy I'll expend looking for ways to subvert or replace them, until I eventually rely on corporations for the absolute minimum possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we'll see some stratification in the self hosting community over the next few years. The current community, centered around /r/selfhosted and /r/homelab, is all about articles like this. The complexity and learning are sources of fun and an end in themselves. That's awesome.&lt;p&gt;But I think there's a large untapped market for people who would love the benefits of self hosting, without needing to learn much if any of it.&lt;p&gt;I think of it similar to kit car builders vs someone who just wants to buy a car to use. Right now, self hosting is dominated by kit cars.&lt;p&gt;If self hosting is ever going to be as turnkey as driving a car, I think we're going to need a new term. I've been leaning towards "indie hosting" personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home labs are great.  They are a good learning tool to understand systems in _isolation_.&lt;p&gt;They're terrible for understanding emergent properties of production systems and how to defend yourself against active and passive attacks.  Critically you also need to know how to unwind an attack after you have been bitten by one.  These are the most important parts of "self hosting."&lt;p&gt;Otherwise,  you might be getting in the habit of building big rube goldberg machines that are never going to be possible to deploy in any real production scenario.&lt;p&gt;Make it real once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to self-host a lot of things:&lt;p&gt;1. My blog&lt;p&gt;2. My friends' blogs&lt;p&gt;3. BIND for all this&lt;p&gt;4. A mail-server on this&lt;p&gt;5. A MySQL database on this&lt;p&gt;All this was on a Hetzner server that was nominally set up to be correct on restart. But I was always scared of that because I built this up from when I was a teenager onwards and didn't trust my younger self and couldn't find the time to audit. 10 years afterwards, with 10 years uptime, and no consequences of data loss or theft (it might have occurred, just that nothing affected me or my friends) Hetzner actually warned me they were going to decomm the underlying instance and no longer supported that VPS.&lt;p&gt;I backed everything up, copied it, and for the last 8 years have faithfully moved from home to home carefully transporting these hard-drives and doing nothing with them.&lt;p&gt;When I finally set up everything again, I did it much more manageably this time, with backups to Cloudflare R2 for the database and resources, and Dockerfiles for the code. I restarted the machine and brought everything up.&lt;p&gt;And now I use GSuite instead of my own mail. I use Cloudflare instead of my own DNS. There's a lot I outsource despite "self-hosting". It's just far more convenient.&lt;p&gt;So the answer is that I had no BCDR on the old thing. Maybe I'll train my kids and have them be my BCDR for the new thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just today I had to sign up for a service and went to bitwarden app on my phone to generate password (linked to self hosted vaultwarden server) but the new password entry couldn’t be saved into the app because the server was unreachable.&lt;p&gt;Then I had to go restart my VM and reconnect my VPN. I am now thinking about switching to bitwarden premium and opt-out of self hosting for password managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small suggestion about resources: try using NixOS/Guix System instead of containers to deploy home services, you'll discover that in a fraction of resources you get much more, stability, documentation and easy replication included.&lt;p&gt;Containers now, like full-stack virtualization on x86 are and was advertisement stuff pushed because proprietary software vendors and cloud providers need them, other do not need them at all and devs who works for themselves and generic users should learn that: if you sell VPS et al. obviously you need them, if you made your own infra from bare metal adding them it's just wasting resources and add dependencies instead of simplify life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I self-host a lot of things myself. There is one scary downside I've learned in a painful way.&lt;p&gt;A friend and I figured all this out together since we met in college in the 1980s. He hosted his stuff and I hosted mine. For example, starting in 1994, we had our own domain names and hosted our own email. Sometimes we used each other for backup (e.g., when we used to host our own DNS for our domains at home as well as for SMTP relays). We also hosted for family and some friends at the same time.&lt;p&gt;Four years ago he was diagnosed with cancer and a year later we lost him. It was hard enough to lose one of the closest friends I ever had. In his last weeks, he asked if I could figure out how to support his family and friends in migrating off the servers in his home rack and onto providers that made more sense for his family's level of technical understanding. This was not simple because I had moved 150 miles away, but of course I said yes.&lt;p&gt;Years later, that migration is close to complete, but it has been far more difficult than any of us imagined. Not because of anything technical, but because every step of it is a reminder of the loss of a dear friend. And that takes me out of the rational mindset I need to be in to migrate things smoothly and safely.&lt;p&gt;But, he did have me as a succession plan. With him gone, I don't have someone who thinks enough like me to be the same for my extended family. I'm used to thinking about things like succession plans at work, but it's an entirely new level to do it at home.&lt;p&gt;So, I still host a lot, but the requirements are much more thoroughly thought through. For example, we use Paperless-ngx to manage our documents. Now there's a cron job that rsync's the collection of PDFs to my wife's laptop every hour so that she will have our important papers if something happens to me.&lt;p&gt;Thinking carefully enough to come up with reliable backups like this makes things noticeably harder because not all solutions are as obvious and simple. And it's not something that ever occurred to us in our 20s and 30s, but our families were one tragedy away from not knowing how to access things that are important soon after we were gone (as soon as the server had trouble). There is more responsibility to this than we previously realized.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><title>Show HN: An open-source implementation of AlphaFold3</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Hi HN - we’re the founders of Ligo Biosciences and are excited to share an open-source implementation of AlphaFold3, the frontier model for protein structure prediction.&lt;p&gt;Google DeepMind and their new startup Isomorphic Labs, are expanding into drug discovery. They developed AlphaFold3 as their model to accelerate drug discovery and create demand from big pharma. They already signed Novartis and Eli Lilly for $3 billion - Google’s becoming a pharma company! (&lt;a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kicks-off-2024-with-two-pharmaceutical-collaborations" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/articles/isomorphic-labs-kick...&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;p&gt;AlphaFold3 is a biomolecular structure prediction model that can do three main things: (1) Predict the structure of proteins; (2) Predict the structure of drug-protein interactions; (3) Predict nucleic acid - protein complex structure.&lt;p&gt;AlphaFold3 is incredibly important for science because it vastly accelerates the mapping of protein structures. It takes one PhD student their entire PhD to do one structure. With AlphaFold3, you get a prediction in minutes on par with experimental accuracy.&lt;p&gt;There’s just one problem: when DeepMind published AlphaFold3 in May (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w&lt;/a&gt;), there was no code. This 
brought up questions about reproducibility (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0&lt;/a&gt;) as well as complaints from the scientific community (&lt;a href="https://undark.org/2024/06/06/opinion-alphafold-3-open-source/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://undark.org/2024/06/06/opinion-alphafold-3-open-sourc...&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;p&gt;AlphaFold3 is a fundamental advance in structure modeling technology that the entire biotech industry deserves to be able to reap the benefits from. Its applications are vast, including:&lt;p&gt;- CRISPR gene editing technologies, where scientists can see exactly how the DNA interacts with the scissor Cas protein;&lt;p&gt;- Cancer research - predicting how a potential drug binds to the cancer target. One of the highlights in DeepMind’s paper is the prediction of a clinical KRAS inhibitor in complex with its target.&lt;p&gt;- Antibody / nanobody to target predictions. AlphaFold3 improves accuracy on this class of molecules 2 fold compared to the next best tool.&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no companies can use it since it is under a non-commercial license!&lt;p&gt;Today we are releasing the full model trained on single chain proteins (capability 1 above), with the other two capabilities to be trained and released soon. We also include the training code. Weights will be released once training and benchmarking is complete. We wanted this to be truly open source so we used the Apache 2.0 license.&lt;p&gt;Deepmind published the full structure of the model, along with each components’ pseudocode in their paper. We translated this fully into PyTorch, which required more reverse engineering than we thought!&lt;p&gt;When building the initial version, we discovered multiple issues in DeepMind’s paper that would interfere with the training - we think the deep learning community might find these especially interesting. (Diffusion folks, we would love feedback on this!) These include:&lt;p&gt;- MSE loss scaling differs from Karras et al. (2022). The weighting provided in the paper does not downweigh the loss at high noise levels.&lt;p&gt;- Omission of residual layers in the paper - we add these back and see benefits in gradient flow and convergence. Anyone have any idea why Deepmind may have omitted the residual connections in the DiT blocks?&lt;p&gt;- The MSA module, in its current form, has dead layers. The last pair weighted averaging and transition layers cannot contribute to the pair representation, hence no grads. We swap the order to the one in the ExtraMsaStack in AlphaFold2. An alternative solution would be to use weight sharing, but whether this is done is ambiguous in the paper.&lt;p&gt;More about those issues here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Ligo-Biosciences/AlphaFold3"&gt;https://github.com/Ligo-Biosciences/AlphaFold3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;How this came about: we are building Ligo (YC S24), where we are using ideas from AlphaFold3 for enzyme design. We thought open sourcing it was a nice side quest to benefit the community.&lt;p&gt;For those on Twitter, there was a good thread a few days ago that has more information:

A huge thanks to OpenFold for pioneering the previous open source implementation of AlphaFold
We did a lot of our early prototyping with proteinFlow developed by Lisa at AdaptyvBio we also look forward to partnering with them to bring you the next versions!
We are also partnering with Basecamp Research to supply this model with the best sequence data known to science. 
Matthew Clark (&lt;a href="https://batisio.co.uk" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://batisio.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;) for his amazing animations!&lt;p&gt;We’re around to answer questions and look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I'm understanding correctly, the model code itself is only a tiny proportion of the challenge.   The training compute and training data are far bigger parts.&lt;p&gt;Google has access to training compute on a scale perhaps nobody else has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, how are predictions verified? Does one still do experimental techniques (X-ray crystallography, cryogenic-em etc.) one you have the prediction? Or are predictions so close to reality you can progress without experiment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably want to change the name of this implementation as it's not truly AlphaFold3.  I wouldn't be surprised if you got a C&amp;D from DM for using the name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you considered publishing your own paper about your implementation? It would make it easier to cite in the literature later on. Would major journals accept such a paper? I would assume they would if they really had questions about reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems really neat!&lt;p&gt;DeepMind and AlphaFold are clearly moving in a closed-source direction, since they created Isomorphic Labs as a division of Alphabet essentially focused on doing this stuff closed source. In theory it seems nice for academic tools to have an open source version, although I'm not familiar enough with this field to point to a specific benefit of it.&lt;p&gt;So what's your plan for the company itself, do you intend to continue working on this open source project as part of your business model, or was it more of a one-off? Your website seems very nonspecific about what exactly you intend to be selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question for bio folks here, and not to steal from the joy of this article but I've been recently curious how far are we from engineering something like a virus that targets a subset of the population (e.g. via specific genetic markers).   This sort of tech being commoditized feels much much scary than the LLM safety talk - by a mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting work but I think something has been intentionally overlooked. Creating proteins is difficult and it's also unclear how many of these sequences folded into the predicted 3d structure. Small molecule synthesis is still easier, cheaper, and more scalable than protein therapeutics. I think this would've been more impactful had they focused on improving on the SOTA small molecule - protein interaction models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my humble opinion, this work is not that innovative: &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein binders have been done to death, either by AI approaches or otherwise. Check out the work by David Baker’s group, for instance. They have a myriad of examples already.&lt;p&gt;That being said, as others have commented, my hopes are that all these advancements lead &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; to reliable design methods for novel biocatalysts, an area that has been stalling for decades, compared to protein folds and binders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question is how specific the binding is -- what's the level of off-target effects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting work, but there's a huge sector they're missing - industrial enzyme and catalysis design.  Most of this field is concerned with small molecule binding  - methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methanol, acetic acid, etc.  Binding is often just the first step, as you're typically trying to do highly specific chemistry, e.g. attaching a single oxygen to methane or a single hydrogen to carbon dioxide, etc.&lt;p&gt;Working in this area might also be good test of their technological approach, as small-molecule binding can be somewhat challenging, and even evolved biological systems can struggle to achieve high specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It generates novel candidates doesn’t actually generate proteins, and none of these proteins have actually been generated to validate whether these candidates are shit or not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is Google actually doing with these systems? Are they using it to develop new drugs themselves? Or licensing it to the pharmaceutical industry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a question that hopefully a molecular biologist can answer.  Can tools like this potentially create protein structures that specifically bind in certain cells?  Or is this more about a way of being able to create proteins for genes / structures we haven't been able to before?&lt;p&gt;I'm very interested in my research at the moment in pleiotropy, namely mapping pleiotropic effects in as many *omics/QTL measurements and complex traits as possible.  This is really helpful for determining which genes / proteins to focus on for drug development.&lt;p&gt;The problem with drugs is in fact pleiotropy!  A single protein can do quite a lot of things in your body, either through a causal downstream mechanism (vertical pleiotropy), or seemingly independent processes (horizontal).  This limits a lot of possible drug target as the side-effect / detrimental effect may be too large.&lt;p&gt;So, if these tools can create ultra specific protein structures that somehow &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; bind in the areas of interest, then that would be a truly massive breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is in the supplement of the whitepaper [0], but I would have loved to see more analysis of how novel the designed proteins really are.&lt;p&gt;In the whitepaper they mention that they are novel compared to other in silico design techniques, but to my knowledge other binders to VEGF and Covid spike protein exist and would already be found in the PDB database that Deepmind trained the model on.&lt;p&gt;This is not to minimize the results- if the history of ML is anything to go by, even if AlphaProteo does not currently beat the best affinity found by in vitro screens, I do not doubt that it soon will!&lt;p&gt;[0] - &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/alphaproteo-generates-novel-proteins-for-biology-and-health-research/AlphaProteo2024.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/B...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone know why the sizes of these models are typically expressed in &lt;i&gt;number&lt;/i&gt; of weights (i.e 1.5B and 9B in this case), without mentioning the weight size in bytes?&lt;p&gt;For practical reasons, I often like to know how much GPU RAM is required to run these models locally.  The actual number of weights seems to only express some kind of relative power, which I doubt is relevant to most users.&lt;p&gt;Edit: reformulated to sound like a genuine question instead of a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone explain these Aider benchmarks to me? They pass same 113 tests through llm every time. Why they then extrapolate ability of llm to pass these 113 basic python challenges to the general ability to produce/edit code? For me it sounds like this or that model is 70% accurate in solving same hundred python training tasks, but why does it mean that it's good at other languages and arbitrary, private tasks as well? Does anyone ever tried to change them test cases or wiggle conditions a bit to see if it will still hit 70%?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds very promising!&lt;p&gt;I hope that Yi-Coder 9B FP16 and Q8 will be available soon for Ollama, right now i only see the 4bit quantized 9B model.&lt;p&gt;I'm assuming that these models will be quite a bit better than the 4bit model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tested this out on my workload ( SRE/Devops/C#/Golang/C++ ).  it started responding about non-sense on a simple write me boto python script that changes x ,y,z value.&lt;p&gt;Then I tried other questions in my past to compare... However, I believe the engineer who did the LLM, just used the questions in benchmarks.&lt;p&gt;One instance after a hour of use ( I stopped then ) it answered one question with 4 different programming languages, and answers that was no way related to the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be good if LLMs were somehow packaged in an easy way/format for us "novice" (ok I mean lazy) users to try them out.&lt;p&gt;I'm not interested so much with the response time (anyone has a couple of spare A100s?), but it would be good to be able to try out different LLMs locally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm new to this whole area and feeling a bit lost. How are people setting up these small LLMs like Yi-Coder locally for tab completion? Does it work natively on VSCode?&lt;p&gt;Also for the cloud models apart from GitHub Copilot, what tools or steps are you all using to get them working on your projects? Any tips or resources would be super helpful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude 3.5 Sonnet still holds the LLM crown for code which I'll use when wanting to check the output of the best LLM, however my Continue Dev, Aider and Claude Dev plugins are currently configured to use DeepSeek Coder V2 236B (and local ollama DeepSeek Coder V2 for tab completions) as it offers the best value at $0.14M/$0.28M which sits just below Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Aider's leaderboard [1] whilst being 43x cheaper.&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; Continue pretrained on 2.4 Trillion high-quality tokens over 52 major programming languages.&lt;p&gt;I'm still waiting for a model that's highly specialised for a single language only - and either a lot smaller than these jack of all trades ones or VERY good at that specific language's nuances + libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been paying for Kagi for the past five or six months and apart from the truly niche cases where I need top of the shelf search results the majority of the time the top results are not that much different from, say, duck duck go. My other issue is that I am on the first subscription tier which currently supports 300 searches and I often find myself reaching that limit sooner that I would like. I will continue to pay for the service, but so far the, admittedly, better results haven't given me this light and day experience other users describe. Maybe I am just not using the engine to its full potential...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using (and paying for) Kagi since the beginning.&lt;p&gt;For the first while, the search results were inarguably better than any alternative. I was thrilled and was recommending Kagi to anyone who'd listen. In the last six months or so, things have gone downhill. More often, my results ignore some of my search terms and I have to try to "trick" Kagi into matching them all. More often, I get only one or two pages of results when other engines give me notably more relevant hits. And more often, my search hangs or fails to return at all.&lt;p&gt;I don't care if they noodle with AI or make T-shirts as long as the search is great. What I've experienced is the search getting worse while they noodle with AI and make T-shirts, though. The two may be entirely unrelated but from an outside perspective, it feels like their core offering is suffering &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of these other-than-search undertakings.&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm sticking with it, but my enthusiasm has definitely diminished. A couple of my friends have canceled their subscriptions in disappointment and I've started to consider cancelling mine, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No markdown blocks for code makes assistants really tough to use. It also seems to end up recommending that you search the exact same thing you ask it. For example, if I ask "name 5 websites similar to hackernews", it'll end up spitting out a link to a kagi search with "websites similar to hackernews".&lt;p&gt;I might end up disabling web search until they've tweaked it a little more. I really like kagi search so I feel pretty confident that they'll get it, but I don't think it's ready to replace the brand-name chatbots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there some reason Brave Search isn't more popular on this site? It already has an incredibly helpful assistant built into the search and it's free. I don't even use Brave Browser (long live Firefox!) but I feel like people are sleeping on theur search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been trying out the new Android app. I know it's still beta, but it sucks big time. I'm a fan and paying user of kagi, just wanted to point that out in case any kagi developer is reading :)&lt;p&gt;among other things, it randomly says I have no connectivity in an awful modal, I click to search and the keyboard doesn't open, I hit "enter" to search and nothing happens (I need to tap on the search suggestion). pretty bad so far. will try it again in a couple of weeks to see if there is any progress...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using Kagi for a while and I like it more that Google but I can't quite see myself paying for Kagi Assistant. I can't see myself paying for almost any pass-through AI subscriptions, I'd rather just pay for the core AI tool (ChatGPT/Claude).&lt;p&gt;This field is moving very quickly and since there will always be a lag in getting new features/models into the "wrappers" I'd rather get it from the source.&lt;p&gt;One random thing I wish Kagi could do is offer a way to promote the "official" website to the top of the search results. I have various up/down rankings applied but when I search for "DataDog" I want their official website at the top of the list, not under SO/Reddit/etc posts. If I'm searching for a problem then yes, I want those sites higher but it's slightly frustrating to have to scroll down 3-5 results to find the main website for a product/service/company. I feel like they should be able to differentiate between "search about X product" vs "X product".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Kagi compare to Brave Search? Is it an independent index?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being a user for a long while, my enthusiasm for Kagi has decreased. Their UI is lovely, but I feel in the end they are just repackaging other indexers. I’ve started using Google + Ublacklist and for me it works the same.
I also don’t like how much they have focused on AI, given even their Quick Answer, when it’s wrong, it does so with such confidence it makes the tool quite untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been using Kagi for a while now. Something I have noticed recently is that it ignores a lot more of the words in my search queries, I felt the same thing with google over time, it shows results it thinks I want not the things I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The library they (probably) use for abstracting the interfaces of different LLMs they use is also open [1]:&lt;p&gt;&gt; PyLLMs is a minimal Python library to connect to various Language Models (LLMs) with a built-in model performance benchmark.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/pyllms"&gt;https://github.com/kagisearch/pyllms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly think FastGPT is the best implementation of AI w/search, and is extremely versatile/useful across domains (granted I don't code). I think it's the same thing as the Quick Answer feature from their standard search.&lt;p&gt;In my daily work as an MD it's become my reflexive go-to for looking up answers to specific to general, easy to complex clinical questions. I use it far more frequently than UpToDate (which is no less than the holy book of medicine), more than PubMed/Google Scholar searches, and definitely more than a basic web search (Google, only b/c it's a hassle to log in to Kagi every session at work).&lt;p&gt;Maybe 1 time out of 10 it won't give a correct or meaningful answer (in which case my prompt needs to be refined, or is just not suited for this kind of tool). But apart from that it will give me exactly what I need, because it uses Kagi search to source its answers. Kagi search does a decent job bringing to the top relevant journal articles (which in turn may mention other articles, adding indirectly to the trove of sources FastGPT pulls its final answer from). It shows the 5 search results it referenced at the bottom of the page, so more often than not if I don't get my answer in the direct summary, I have very relevant sources to read through.&lt;p&gt;I also don't think you need a Kagi account to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Kagi Ultimate subscription intensively for approximately seven months and am considering downgrading now.&lt;p&gt;While I am still happy with the search, I find the value of the assistant no longer worth it. At first, I thought I would be able to replace other providers with the wide range of offered models, but now I find myself often going to distinct providers. Kagi seems to have introduced a harsh and generalized input token limit for prompts (detached from what the underlying model can handle), which makes it almost impossible to work with code or documents. I think the VW example in the announcement makes it clear that the assistant is only intended to respond to prompts of a few sentences—searching by sentences instead of keywords. I don't see input for documents or things like code execution coming here, so the difference of $15 monthly can get me fancier features.&lt;p&gt;Mixing the output of the model with the limited content of approximately five websites (= Assistant with internet access), on average, is most of the time counterproductive for me. The sites mentioned in the sources of the output are often not sites I would usually visit or get information from (they usually don't correspond to the top results on Kagi web search). I have used search engines for decades now and have built a sort of index/pattern/feeling in my head for which site I am going to visit, which AI can not match for me.&lt;p&gt;The lenses are nice but are also pretty specialized. Most of the time I find myself just doing a broad query, which in most cases will already satisfy me.&lt;p&gt;I will definitely continue to use Kagi for search. There is no comparable search experience out there, and it makes searching definitely more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't know how to make this more meaningful than just an anecdote, but I love the idea of Kagi but just cancelled my subscription. All the issues about google search becoming more and more useless are absolutely true, but I still continue to get much better results for most topics with Google than Kagi. Same for Kagi's LLM products compared to directly using Claude or others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really cool. I'm very against AI in everything, so I probably won't use this, but I'm glad that they are making it an opt-in feature and that my $10/month plan doesn't go up to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLMs + search are really useful. I use phind.com regularly for this, it is remarkably good for enhanced search queries. I use Claude a lot for more general knowledge stuff but its inability to provide references or do web search like stuff holds it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder how other engines compare when it comes to LODs and similar systems.&lt;p&gt;Godot has automatic LOD which seems pretty cool for what it is: &lt;a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/3d/mesh_lod...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unity also has an LOD system, though despite how popular the engine is, you have to create LOD models manually: &lt;a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html&lt;/a&gt; (unless you dig through the asset store and find a plugin)&lt;p&gt;I did see an interesting approach in a lesser known engine called NeoAxis: &lt;a href="https://www.neoaxis.com/docs/html/NeoAxis_Levels.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.neoaxis.com/docs/html/NeoAxis_Levels.htm&lt;/a&gt; however that engine ran very poorly for me on my old RX580, although I haven't tried on my current A580.&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, Unreal is really quite far ahead of the competition when it comes to putting lots of things on the screen, except the downside of this is that artists will be tempted to include higher quality assets in their games, bloating the install sizes quite far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been mentioned a couple of times in this thread, but Bevy also has an implementation of Nanite's ideas (sometimes called Virtual Geometry). I'm the author of that, happy to answer questions :)&lt;p&gt;As for this project, Scthe did a great job! I've been talking with them about several parts of the process, culminating in some improvements to Bevy's code based on their experience (&lt;a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15023"&gt;https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15023&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;Note: this isn't actually UE5 Nanite in WebGPU. It's a totally independent implementation of the same idea as Nanite.&lt;p&gt;This technique is starting to appear in a variety of places. Nanite definitely made the idea famous, but Nanite is the name a specific implementation, not the name of the technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I see rendered scenes like this (I.e., lots of repetitive static geometry) I imagine that annoying guy’s voice going on about “unlimited detail” from that old vaporware video. I guess nanite really did solve that problem for real, as opposed to whatever that old thing was using (I remember something about oct-trees or something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, I can't remember the last time I read a project summary with so much jargon - I literally didn't understand anything:&lt;p&gt;&gt; UE5's Nanite implementation using WebGPU. Includes the meshlet LOD hierarchy, software rasterizer and billboard impostors. Culling on both per-instance and per-meshlet basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name and description are very confusing and a trademark violation since despite the claims it seems to be completely unrelated to actual Nanite in UE5, just an implementation of something similar by a person unaffiliated with UE5.&lt;p&gt;There is also Bevy's Virtual Geometry that provides similar functionality and is probably much more useful since it's written in Rust and integrated with a game engine: &lt;a href="https://jms55.github.io/posts/2024-06-09-virtual-geometry-bevy-0-14/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://jms55.github.io/posts/2024-06-09-virtual-geometry-be...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I asked an AI following question&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  const MyClass&amp; getMyClass(){....}
  auto obj = getMyClass();

  this makes a copy right?
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
And it was very confident about it not making a copy. It thinks auto will deduce the type as a const ref and not make a copy. Which is wrong, you need auto&amp; or const auto&amp; for that. I asked it if it is sure and it was even more confident.&lt;p&gt;Here is the godbolt output &lt;a href="https://godbolt.org/z/Mz8x74vxe" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://godbolt.org/z/Mz8x74vxe&lt;/a&gt; . You can see the "copy" being printed. And you can also see you can call non-const methods on copied object, which implies it is a non-const type&lt;p&gt;I asked the very same question to phind and it gave the same answer
&lt;a href="https://www.phind.com/search?cache=k3l4g010kuichh9rp4dl9ikb"&gt;https://www.phind.com/search?cache=k3l4g010kuichh9rp4dl9ikb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;How come two different AIs, one was supposed to be specialized on coding, fails in such a confident way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive given up on phind. The company seems like a bit of a dodgy black hole in terms of what they do with information (the answer is - i dont know, but i requested to try find out so my company could use them and got no reply). Seems untrustworthy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that LMM should not produce answers to questions. Instead, they should generate keywords, make keyword search and give quotes from human-written material as an answer.&lt;p&gt;So what LLM should do is only search and filter human-written material.&lt;p&gt;An example of search query is "What is the temporal duration between striking adjacent strings to form a chord on a guitar?". Google (being just a dumb keyword search engine) produces mostly unrelated search results (generally answering what chords there are and how does one play them). Phind also cannot answer: [1]&lt;p&gt;However, when I asked a LLM what keywords I should use to find this, it suggested "guitar chord microtiming" among other choices, which allows to find a research work containing the answer (5 to 12 ms if someone is curious).&lt;p&gt;[1] &lt;a href="https://www.phind.com/search?cache=u4xiqluairg3zkdaxstcr39v"&gt;https://www.phind.com/search?cache=u4xiqluairg3zkdaxstcr39v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, wait this is actually doing a really good job.&lt;p&gt;I still have to ask follow up questions to get reasonable results but when I tested earlier this year it was outright failing on most of my test queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using Phind this past week and it's been &lt;i&gt;excellent&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;One of our vendors insisted on whitelisting the IPs we were going to call them from, and our deployments went through AWS copilot/Fargate directly to the public subnets. Management had fired the only person with infrastructure experience a few months ago (very small company), and nobody left knew anything about networking.&lt;p&gt;Within about a week, Phind brought me from questions like "What is a VPC?" "What is a subnet?" to having set up the NAT gateways, diagnosing deploy problems and setting up the VPC endpoints in AWS' crazy complicated setup, and gotten our app onto the private subnet and routing outbound traffic through the NAT for that vendor.&lt;p&gt;Yes, it occasionally spit out nonsense (using the free/instant model). I even caught it blatantly lying about its sources once. Even so, once I asked the right questions it helped me learn and execute &lt;i&gt;so much faster&lt;/i&gt; than I would have trying to cobble understanding through ordinary google searches, docs, and blog posts.&lt;p&gt;Strongly recommended if you're ever wading into a new/unfamiliar topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their example is: stealing content, to make a sketchy-looking pile of worthless BS.&lt;p&gt;Then I realized that this pattern &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the biggest application of LLMs right now.&lt;p&gt;So I guess they're just acknowledging the target market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A key issue with AI-powered search is that it is just too slow compared to classic Google. Even if it generates a better answer, the added latency is discouraging."&lt;p&gt;Is this true? I feel like most complaints I have and hear about is how inaccurate some of the AI results are. I.e. the mistakes it confidently makes when helping you code.&lt;/p&gt;

<item><title>Show HN: AnythingLLM – Open-Source, All-in-One Desktop AI Assistant</title><description>
&lt;p&gt;Hey HN!&lt;p&gt;This is Tim from AnythingLLM (&lt;a href="https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm"&gt;https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm&lt;/a&gt;). AnythingLLM is an open-source desktop assistant that brings together RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), agents, embeddings, vector databases, and more—all in one seamless package.&lt;p&gt;We built AnythingLLM over the last year iterating and iterating from user feedback. Our primary mission is to enable people with a layperson understanding of AI to be able to use AI with little to no setup for either themselves, their jobs, or just to try out using AI as an assistant but with *privacy by default*.&lt;p&gt;From these iterations &amp; feedback, we have a couple of key learnings I wanted to share:&lt;p&gt;- "Chat with your docs" solutions are a dime-a-dozen&lt;p&gt;- Agent frameworks require knowing how to code or are too isolated from other tools&lt;p&gt;- Users do not care about benchmarks, only outputs. The magic box needs to be magic to them.&lt;p&gt;- Asking Consumers to start a docker container or open a terminal is a non-starter for most.&lt;p&gt;- Privacy by default is non-negotiable. Either by personal preference or legal constraints&lt;p&gt;- Everything needs to be in one place&lt;p&gt;From these ideas, we landed on the current state of AnythingLLM:&lt;p&gt;- Everything in AnythingLLM is private by default, but fully customizable for advanced users.&lt;p&gt;- Built-in LLM provider, but can swap at any time to the hundreds of other local or cloud LLM providers &amp; models.&lt;p&gt;- Built-in Vector Database, most users don't even know that it is there.&lt;p&gt;- Built-in Embedding model, but of course can change if the user wants to.&lt;p&gt;- Scrape websites, import Github/GitLab repos, YouTube Transcripts, Confluence spaces - all of this is already built in for the user.&lt;p&gt;- An entire baked-in agent framework that works seamlessly within the app. We even pre-built a handful of agent skills for customers. Custom plugins are in the next update and will be able to be built with code, or a no-code builder.&lt;p&gt;- All of this just works out of the box in a single installable app that can run on any consumer-grade laptop. Everything a user does, chats, or configures is stored on the user's device. Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux&lt;p&gt;We have been actively maintaining and working on AnythingLLM via our open-source repo for a while now and welcome contributors as we hopefully launch a Community Hub soon to really proliferate users' abilities to add more niche agent skills, data connectors, and more.&lt;p&gt;*But there is even more*&lt;p&gt;We view the desktop app as a hyper-accessible single-player version of AnythingLLM. We publish a Docker image too (&lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mintplexlabs/anythingllm" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://hub.docker.com/r/mintplexlabs/anythingllm&lt;/a&gt;) that supports multi-user management with permissioning so that you can easily bring AnythingLLM into an organization with all of the same features with minimal headache or lift.&lt;p&gt;The Docker image is for those more adept with a CLI, but being able to comfortably go from a single-user to a multi-user version of the same familiar app was very important for us.&lt;p&gt;AnythingLLM aims to be more than a UI for LLMs, we are building a comprehensive tool to leverage LLMs and all that they can do while maintaining user privacy and not needing to be an expert on AI to do it.&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://anythingllm.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://anythingllm.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been attempting to deploy a customized AnythingLLM instance within an enterprise env. TimC (and presumably dev crew) are top notch and very responsive.&lt;p&gt;Waiting for EntraID integration. Post-that, a customized version of AnythingLLM can tick the boxes for most of the lowest hanging use cases for an org.&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the killer app TimC and crew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a coincidence, I just setup AnythingLLM yesterday for trying it on an enterprise level. I'm super impressed with most of the stuff I used so far.&lt;p&gt;I just wish there was an option to properly include custom CSS. The default interface looks a little bit.. dated.&lt;p&gt;Keep up the amazing work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question on the anythingllm hosted.  So is the $50/mo just basically you are logging into some sort of Remote Desktop environment and run an anythingllm instance from there that you guys manage?  Everything else is still the same like it’s still byok and all that right?  Or do you get some sort of “ai/token” usage with the monthly fee as well?&lt;p&gt;Oh and the other question would be in your hosted version does the instance have access to a gpu that you provide?  Which in that case we could just use a local model with (relative) ease right?&lt;p&gt;And if this hosted service is as I have described, I feel like this sort of service coupled with top tier frontier open source models is the (not too distant) future for AI!—- at least in the short to medium term (which is probably a pretty short period relatively, given the rapid speed of AI development).&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've got an open ai API key, and I pay for chatgpt. I'd imagine switching to this and using openai would end up costing quite a lot? How are people running it relatively cheaply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who doesn't know what an Embed or Vector is, this has been the only offline AI tool I've been able to install and start using on my standard office PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is really nice.  My first reaction was "oh great, another Ollama/WebGenUI wrapper on Llama.cpp" but it's actually much more - supporting not only the LLM but also embedding models, vector databases, and TTS/STT.  Everything needed to build a fully functioning voice chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is super sweet for developers (or anyone else) who like to have granular control over their LLM set up&lt;p&gt;- ability to edit system prompt&lt;p&gt;- ability to change LLM temperature&lt;p&gt;- can choose which model to use (open-source or closed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This definitely makes it super easy for less technical folks to access it ( got it up and running in less than 5 minutes ). Initial reaction is positive with just Ollama. Everything is automatically detected and if you want to manually set it up, you still can. Lets see how it does after adding huggingface ( quick and painless ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed you put LiteLLM in your list of providers.  Was that just marketing, or did you re-implement model support for all the models LiteLLM already supports separately?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; AnythingLLM packages as an AppImage but you will not be able to boot if you run just the AppImage.&lt;p&gt;The 'boot' seems to indicate it will affect the computer's startup process, I think you meant to say you will not be able to 'start the application'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks sweet.&lt;p&gt;Totally irrelevant but ... "Language Learning Model" ? Probably just some brainfart or I'm missing something but it would be hilarious if the authors of this did this whole project without knowing what LLM stands for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LLM will become like web frameworks in the future, in the sense that they will be free, open source, and everybody will be able to build on them. Sure, there will be paid options, such as there are paid web frameworks, but most of the time free options will be more than good enough for most of the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

The citations seem to be a bit dicey. The response seems to give largely correct answers but the citations window seems to show content that's a bit garbled.&lt;p&gt;2. Please please add a text search to search within existing chat content. Like if I searched for something about giraffes in one of the chats, search chat history and allow switching to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any software that can generate CSS visually by combining nodes in a graph, akin to shader graphs in game engines? (&lt;a href="https://unity-connect-prd.storage.googleapis.com/20200902/learn/images/01aea200-0139-4f96-a445-e5001bef8312_image10.png" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://unity-connect-prd.storage.googleapis.com/20200902/le...&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;It remind me times when I participate in development of VRML Engine.
VRML can include JavaScript, but it has timers &amp; interpolations of almost anything (coordinates, texture coordinates, any properties of transformation like angle or axe of rotation, scale, etc) without using scripts. And even can process input events without scripts! It is possible to create simple 3D game without any "real programming" in VRML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, so `@property` isn't scoped by anything else other than the variable name itself right? That means an explicit single global scope for variable names, which is not a new thing but never affected the actual usage until now. I can easily imagine a future where variable names are mangled just like class names...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, modern CSS would be useful in a non-web configuration language role too, but almost nobody seriously considers it --- instead preferring the usual ad-hoc mix of JSON, YAML, and TOML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point we really need a CSS blocker because it's going to be used to plaster ads and annoyances all over websites that used to require javascript and were easily solved by blocking JS by default. CSS is becoming so complex that it'll be as much of a security risk as JS.&lt;p&gt;Preferably a blocker that allows a sane subset of CSS so that normal formatting isn't impacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm excited about the recent work on CSS (particular Houdini). I haven't felt like this since I got a book of IE 5.5 features. Don't get me wrong -- CSS has gotten a lot of new features over the last 14 years, but they've been like basic things you kind of expect in a style framework, like new layout options or variables.&lt;p&gt;But IE devs were unhinged. You could build JS code as a module and attach it to elements using CSS.&lt;p&gt;Finally we're getting those kind of unhinged features again.&lt;p&gt;e.g. &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/houdini" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/houdini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reads like way before 2011. Just the mention of phone books puts the time frame into the late 90s early 2000s. I haven’t seen a phone book for at least 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, Reddit used to be amazing before it got TikTok-ified. Super high quality content (like this); a lot of which was real. Why can't we have nice things?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Portugal, you can take a mortgage with an optional insurance to exempt you from payments if unemployed up to 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I helped a co-worker evict a guy who had been missing and short rent payments on and off for over a year. Less than a year later the evictee passed away living rough on the street and unsheltered.&lt;p&gt;His wife had divorced him a while earlier, and by the time he was evicted the carpet was filled with dog poop and pee, some partially cleaned up, some not.&lt;p&gt;The guy was an accountant. One would assume that a professional like that would be able to get access to help; would be able to figure out what's going on and change course.&lt;p&gt;I don't know or remember enough of his story to really make a point. It sucks that he died. It sucks that I'm part of a chain of events that accelerated that. It sucks that people get drawn into things like gambling and drugs. It sucks that people are unhoused in a country with access to a surplus of resources.&lt;p&gt;By the time someone gets to intensive care in a hospital, a nurse can 'save their life' 5 times in a night, just for them to die the next day. This guy could have lived more years, but it's really hard to know what those years would have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And so I listen. I feign dispassion but I'm not fooling anybody. Somehow they can tell that I care and thank me even as they admit that it isn't my fault, that it isn't my responsibility to listen. I've stood inside another's dream for an hour as they spoke, not really to be heard but to say goodbye - to leave the ghosts behind.”&lt;p&gt;A nice reminder that, in literally every possible situation, even just a little bit of kindness and humanity can go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy is even sadder when you find out that the foreclosure crisis and Great Recession were self-inflicted by the Federal Reserve and CFPB after 2007, not the inevitable result of reckless borrowers. Kevin Erdmann has been studying this for about a decade and gives examples of cities such as Atlanta that had no housing boom at all but were forced into foreclosure crisis. Here is his most recent op-ed: &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/05/housing-crisis-mortgages-kamala-harris-plan/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/05/housing-c...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrific writing even if difficult to read. This hits close to home, my family and relatives left our homes because of a war, we were on the wrong side of the fence. The experiences of these people are not much different. Maybe we can do better in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents build a big ass house in the middle of nowhere around the year 2000&lt;p&gt;It was a nice place! rooms for the kids, a pool, etc.&lt;p&gt;Then 2008 hit. WOW. We went from a prosperous family to NOTHING incredibly fast.&lt;p&gt;This asset was so toxic the bank wouldn't even fucking take it. It was an albatross for YEARS and my parents had to liquidate their 100 year old family business, and all other assets before they could wiggle out from under it in 2014.&lt;p&gt;For little podunk rust belt towns, there was no "recovery." The car parts plant was gone. The tire plant was gone. The steel casting plant was gone. EVERYTHING went to Mexico. Why buy a nice place if there is no job to support it?&lt;p&gt;That house now sits empty out on a lot next to a closed down golf course. So it goes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my ex-wife and I were first house shopping in Chicago, we looked at a handful of short sales¹ and I am still haunted by the site of one defeated homeowner sitting on the sofa of his home as we looked around his home deciding if we wanted to buy it.²&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;p&gt;1. For those who don’t know, a short sale is one step up from foreclosure: The homeowner and lender agree to a sale for less than the outstanding balance on the mortgage. The buyer must not be related to the seller and the seller does receive a few thousand dollars of the sale proceeds. On the flipside, the amount of the mortgage that is not paid off is considered income and the seller must pay taxes on that.&lt;p&gt;2. We ended up not buying any of the short sale homes in the community where we were looking, but instead purchased a home that was a traditional sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've had a handful of lemons thrown at me during my life. One of the most impactful ones as far as I can tell is that through a weird chain of coincidences I ended up first in line to purchase a foreclosed home. From what I understood, the couple was going through a nasty divorce and couldn't agree on who would get the house and ultimately didn't pay anything for a while, so I picked it up for 80k, which back then was probably 50% of what the market value was. This was hige for kme because as a kid my family was actually evicted from the house we were renting (not for financial-related reasons) but it was sudden so home security has always been important to me.&lt;p&gt;Having been able to pay off my house has had the most tremendous postive impact on my mental health I think. Sure, it's a small house, and it's old, and the kitchen is small, and so on... but man, I'm so glad I never have to worry about making a house payment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've seen a few sides of money. Raised upper class, lost it all and became underclass, then made it back. I'm always amazed at how limited rich people's worldview is. The average software developer, coastal liberal etc. They've never felt terror, the visceral feeling of being terrified. They've never been predated upon. They've never been used and discarded. The underclass lives with this stuff every day, 24/7, and rich people never experience it even once in their whole lives. And the rich people presume to talk down to and lecture the poor. I have a great deal of contempt for people of my class, the rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent about 20 years in the mortgage and housing industry, a decent amount of that in servicing and default. I have seen some shady shit including borrowers who committed mortgage fraud and lenders who made loans they knew would ultimately blow up in someone's face (not theirs!).&lt;p&gt;That said, 99% of defaults are very simple: At the time of the loan, the borrower could afford to make the mortgage payment. Later down the road, something changes in their circumstance, and they can no longer afford to make the monthly payment (or anything close enough to work out a deal). The most common reasons are a loss of income or severe medical issues.&lt;p&gt;Mortgage servicers and investors almost never want to foreclose on a home. An extended default leading to a foreclosure is very costly, and the servicer is usually fronting the money to the investor the entire time. Everyone loses when a foreclosure happens (though only one party doesn't have a home anymore).&lt;p&gt;I am profoundly sympathetic to anyone who gets evicted, but lenders only make mortgage loans because the property is collateral. How else would someone front a normal borrower hundreds of thousands of dollars?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There needs to be some standard addendum attached to homes as an option that anyone selling a home can attach to the sale. Something like:&lt;p&gt;This house cannot be used as an investment vehicle. It cannot be sold by a real-estate agent with a contract of more than 1%. It cannot be used as a rental. It cannot be sold for more than inflation would allow.&lt;p&gt;Anyone found violating this addendum may be sued. All proceeds from the lawsuit (after fair lawyer fee of 40%) shall be used to build new homes (as in it can only be used to fund actual building materials, not generic non-profit companies).&lt;p&gt;This might not be the best approach, but we need a home renaissance that redefines home ownership across the world so that no one has to be homeless anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a short story in my youth -- it must have been by Paul Jennings -- about a boy who got bit by a weird bug. His skin turned transparent and he had to go live in a cave.&lt;p&gt;Many years go by and he gets bit again and his skin goes back to normal. He finally returns to society, only to find that everyone has gone transparent, and he is once again an outcast...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know they say "not tested in humans," but I don't think anybody's going to convince me &lt;i&gt;nobody&lt;/i&gt; in the lab tried it out when they thought nobody was looking, unless there's some really obvious (to experts) reason to assume this &lt;i&gt;won't&lt;/i&gt; work in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&gt; The team then smeared the yellow dye on a mouse’s underbelly, making the abdominal skin see-through and revealing the rodent’s intestines and organs.&lt;p&gt;&gt; The procedure has not yet been tested on humans and researchers will need to show it is safe to use, particularly if the dye is injected beneath the skin.&lt;p&gt;How did they resist the urge to sneak a peak at their own arm or one of their fingers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm quite interested in how the use of tartrazine has been regulated around the world.&lt;p&gt;In my home country, for example, it's not permitted for use in food. Many other places, however, allow this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wonder if this has potential for internal imaging too?&lt;p&gt;For example, with an endoscope or other thing that checks internal passageways.  Applying this stuff (or whatever is appropriate to the given organ) could potentially allow the optical visibility of more stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post's headline for this article is:&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scientists use food dye found in Doritos to make see-through mice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first reaction was, what the heck have I been smoking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huh, I never expected to find out that the Ghouls from Leiber’s &lt;i&gt;Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser&lt;/i&gt; books were actually plausible.&lt;p&gt;(They were perfectly normal medieval fantasy humans, except for their flesh and organs being mostly transparent, so you just saw a pinkish skeleton with a faint shimmer around it.)&lt;/p&gt;
